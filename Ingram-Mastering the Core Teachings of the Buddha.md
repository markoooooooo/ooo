## Highlights
The essential point about meditation is this: to get anywhere in meditation you need to be able to steady the mind and be present in the present. That's all there is to it and it is largely a question of just doing it. — location: [677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=677) ^ref-30934

---
continuous concentration versus moment-to-moment concentration. — location: [682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=682) ^ref-18193

---
Let's begin by taking it as a wholesome given that there is some understanding that is completely beyond any ordinary understanding, even beyond the skillful altered states of consciousness that can be attained if we train well in concentration. The next premise is that there are specific practices that can and will lead to that understanding if we simply do them. The third and perhaps most vital premise is that we can do these specific practices and be successful. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=760) ^ref-34618

---
Insight practice can seem more daunting, complex, or bizarre than other forms of practice. However, it is oddly simple. There are six sense doors. Sensations arise and vanish. Notice this for every sensation. — location: [783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=783) ^ref-411

---
The gold standard for training in morality is how consciously harmless, kind, skillful, and compassionate our intentions, words, and actions are and how well we lead a useful and moral life. — location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=793) ^ref-39905

---
The gold standard for training in concentration is how quickly we can enter into specific, skillful, altered states of consciousness on our own meditative power, how long we can stay in them, and how refined, complete, and stable we can make those states. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=794) ^ref-57485

---
The gold standard for training in wisdom with insight practices is that we can quickly and consistently perceive the true nature of the countless quick sensations that make up our whole reality, regardless of what those sensations are, allowing us to cut to a level of understanding that goes utterly beyond specific conditions but includes them all. — location: [796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=796) ^ref-45329

---
Having gained at least enough morality to be temporarily free of agitating negative mind states and enough concentration to steady the mind, turn your attention to the bare truth of the sensations of this moment. This is called insight meditation, which is designed to produce a form of knowledge or wisdom that can transform and free us from our core perceptual misinterpretations of sensate reality. — location: [801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=801) ^ref-32434

---
Many people try to make insight practices into an exercise that will produce both insights into the ordinary world and ultimate insights. There are numerous traditions that specifically advocate for this sort of practice that attempts to work on both fronts simultaneously. However, I have concluded that we should not count on ultimate teachings to illuminate or resolve our relative issues or vice versa. — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=811) ^ref-39160

---
Therefore, it is extremely important not only to practice all three trainings, but also not to conflate the relative and ultimate wisdom teachings. Failure to do so causes endless problems and makes progress more difficult. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=813) ^ref-21590

---
They falsely imagine that by training in insight they have mastered or gone beyond the training in or need for morality. We awaken to the actual truth of our life in all its conventional aspects, so make sure that yours is a life you want to wake up to. — location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=820) ^ref-53331

---
The three characteristics of impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self are so central to the Buddha's teachings that it is almost inconceivable how little attention the majority of “insight” meditators give them. I cannot possibly overstate the usefulness of trying again and again to really discern these three qualities of all experience. They are the stuff from which ultimate insight at all stages comes, pure and simple. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=827) ^ref-45444

---
“Understand the true nature of things,” what I mean is, “Directly perceive the three characteristics.” To perceive them thoroughly and directly is to be awakened. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=831) ^ref-49806

---
Somehow this exceedingly important message doesn't typically seem to get through to insight meditators, so they spend much time doing anything but looking precisely, moment to moment, into the three characteristics. They may be thinking about something, lost in the stories and tape loops of the mind, trying to work out their stuff, philosophizing, trying to quiet the mind, or who knows what, and this can go on retreat after… — location: [832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=832) ^ref-45172

The big message here is: drop the stories.

Regarding impermanence, it is wise to reflect on our own mortality, a common reflection in many Buddhist traditions, for it is useful and true. This is a reflection on ordinary reality and thus an aspect of training in morality that is commonly used to develop motivation to train in insight.

---
Some people can get all into complex wave or particle models here, but do yourself a favor and don't. Just examine your actual experience, especially something nice and physical like the motion and sensations of the breath in the abdomen, the sensations of the tips of the fingers, the lips, the bridge of the nose, beneath the nose and above the lip, or the subtle tingling on the scalp and so on. Instant by instant, try to know when the actual physical sensations are there and when they are not. — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=872) ^ref-12862

---
It turns out they are not there a good bit of the time, and even when they are, they are changing constantly. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=876) ^ref-14380

---
Being clear about exactly when the physical sensations are present will begin to clarify their slippery counterparts—flickering mental impressions—that help co-create the illusion of continuity, stability, or solidity. — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=879) ^ref-5515

---
This habit of creating a mental impression following any of the physical sensations is the standard way the mind operates on phenomena that are no longer actually there, even mental sensations such as seemingly auditory thoughts, that is, mental talk (our inner “voice”), intentions, and mental images. It is like an echo, a resonance. The mind forms a general impression of the object, and that is what we can think about, remember, and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical pulse. Since I just used this dangerous — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=884) ^ref-24686

“Some people say there is mind. I say there is no mind, but never mind! Heh, heh, heh!” — location: [891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=891) ^ref-7989

---
there are only utterly transient mental sensations. Truly, there is no stable, unitary, discrete entity called “mind” that can be located! — location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=893) ^ref-15468

---
Each one of these sensations (the physical sensation and the mental impression) arises and vanishes completely before another begins, so it is possible to sort out which is which with relatively stable attention dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=895) ^ref-22093

---
This means that the instant you have experienced something, you can know that it isn't there anymore, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=897) ^ref-42747

---
There are typically many other momentary sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=899) ^ref-11880

---
Given that you now know that sensations are vibrating, pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice, every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now know exactly what you are looking for. — location: [901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=901) ^ref-5211

---
You have a clear standard. If you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and develop more clarity about exactly when and where there are physical sensations. Spend time with this, as long as it takes. The whole goal is to experience momentariness directly, that is, things flickering, and what those things are doesn't matter one bit! — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=902) ^ref-39960

---
Interpretation is particularly useless in insight meditation, so you don't have to spend time doing it when you are on the cushion. — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=905) ^ref-20432

---
Thoughts, even supposedly good ones, are just too slippery and seductive most of the time, even for advanced meditators, though if you can avoid getting lost in their content they are as valid a stream of sensate objects for insight practices as any other. — location: [907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=907) ^ref-51324

---
When doing insight practices, try to limit yourself to no more than a few minutes of skillful reflection per hour of meditation. This should be more than enough. There are simply no substitutes for this sort of momentum in practice. If you can get that reflection down to no minutes at all, so much the better. — location: [908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=908) ^ref-34045

---
How fast are things vibrating? How many sensations arise and vanish each second? — location: [911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=911) ^ref-1225

---
Try it! Count “one, one thousand” and tap with each syllable. So, you now know you can experience at least eight things in a second! You experienced the four syllables and the four taps that went along with them. You probably experienced all sorts of other things also, like sights, sounds, other physical sensations, and a lot more during that one second. Yay! That is insight practice. You are already up to at least eight sensations per second. Yay, you! — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=918) ^ref-47239

---
Investigate reality that fast and you will learn some seriously cool things. Add in noticing the intentions to tap each of those taps and the mental impressions of all of the sensations you just experienced, and suddenly you are rockin’ it like a boss in the world of insight meditation. — location: [923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=923) ^ref-32485

---
There are faster and slower vibrations that may show up, some very fast (maybe up to forty times per second or so) and some very slow (that are actually made up of faster vibrations), but let's just say that one to ten times per second can sometimes be a useful guideline in the beginning. Once you get the hang of it, the faster and slower vibrations are no big deal. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=925) ^ref-38876

---
However, in the beginning you should go for faster vibrations over slower ones and then later try for broader and more inclusive ones over those that are narrower. — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=931) ^ref-51135

---
Don't worry if things look or feel solid sometimes. Just be with the solidity clearly and precisely, but not too tightly, and that pattern of sensations that implies solidity can start to reveal its impermanence. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=932) ^ref-41430

---
Be aware of each exact moment in which you experience solidity and its beginning and ending. Remember that each experience of solidity is a discrete, impermanent sensation. — location: [934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=934) ^ref-32680

---
Still, the general concept that you are looking for something changing moderately fast but still quite manageable is key. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=936) ^ref-13864

---
It is also worth noting here that the frequency or rate of vibrations may change often, either getting faster or slower, and that it is worth trying to perceive clearly the beginning and ending of each vibration or pulse of reality. These are actually at least two different sensations! — location: [943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=943) ^ref-35761

---
It is also useful to check out exactly what happens at the bottom, middle, and top of the breath if you are using the breath as an object, and to examine if the frequency remains stable or changes in each phase of the breath. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=945) ^ref-26307

---
Finding the exact end of the out-breath is a commonly used exercise of great profundity once mastered. — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947) ^ref-49594

---
Never assume that what you have understood is a final, fixed answer. Be alert. Explore carefully and precisely with openness and acceptance. This is the door to understanding. — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947) ^ref-17585

---
One last thing about vibrations: exploring vibrations can be a lot like any other sport. We can think of it the same way as we would of surfing or playing tennis, and this playful game-like attitude can help a lot. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=949) ^ref-6097

---
You don't know quite what the next return or wave is going to be like, so pay attention, keep the mind on the pulse of the sensations of your world just as you would on the wave or ball, and keep playing! — location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=951) ^ref-45200

---
you can perceive one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity shatters. — location: [958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=958) ^ref-56925

---
In short, when doing insight practices, constantly work to perceive sensations arise and pass as quickly and accurately as you possibly can. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=959) ^ref-56947

---
With the spirit of a race car driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and still stay on the track, stay on the cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations quickly and accurately. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=960) ^ref-11507

---
In one of these exercises, I sit quietly in a quiet place, close my eyes, put my right hand on my right knee, my left hand on my left knee, and concentrate just on my two index fingers. Basic dharma theory tells me that it is not possible to perceive both fingers simultaneously; so, with this knowledge, I try to see in each instant which one of the two fingers’ physical sensations are being perceived at any given moment. Once the mind has sped up a bit and become more stable, I try to perceive the arising and passing of each of these sensations. I may do this for half an hour or an hour, just staying with the sensations in my two fingers and perceiving when each sensation is and is not there. — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=965) ^ref-15180

---
the illusion of a separate perceiver is partially supported by one impermanent sensation incorrectly seeming to perceive another impermanent sensation which it follows, such as the sensations in the back of the head incorrectly seeming to perceive the sensations of the front of the head, — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=976) ^ref-10027

---
the second aspect of dukkha is the key for insight practices, and that is the inherent painful tension that comes because we take the sensate data coming in and misinterpret those sensations in a way that causes us to habitually create the illusion of a permanent, separate, independently functioning (acausal), localized self. This mode of perceiving experience is more painful than the other way that sensate reality can be perceived, in which sensate data imply the exact reverse: that there is naturally occurring, causal, self-perceiving, immediate transience. Insight practices can show us this other, less painful way of perceiving reality, and eventually hardwire it into our systems so that we don't go back to the more painful way which involves the dukkha created by this misperception. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1049) ^ref-13511

---
Remember that awakening is not a thing or a mind state or a thought, it is an understanding of perspective without some separate entity that perceives. — location: [1061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1061) ^ref-18701

---
Once you have some mental stability, you can even examine the bare experience of the sensations that make up the stories that spin in your mind and see how unsatisfactory and unsettling it is to try to pretend they are a self or the property of some imagined self. If we continue to habituate ourselves to this understanding moment to moment we may get it into our thick heads and finally awaken. — location: [1082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1082) ^ref-52014

---
At a rate of one to ten times per second, try to experience exactly how you know that you wish to do something other than simply face your current experience as it is. Moment to moment, try to discern every little uncomfortable shift, urge, impulse, and tension that prods your mind into fantasizing about the past or future or stopping the meditation entirely. For that meditation period, they become my prey and nourishment, opportunities to understand something extraordinary about reality, and so I do my very best to let none of them arise and pass without clearly perceiving and acknowledging the basic sense of dissatisfaction in relation to them. So, for that period try to: — location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1097) ^ref-60712

---
However, I have found that this kind of investigation pays off in ways I could never have imagined. Later, I will explain a stage called “the Knowledges of Suffering”, aka “the Dark Night”. If you find yourself having trouble with that phase of practice, come back here and try this exercise, as it can turn the tables on something that otherwise might turn the tables on you. — location: [1109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1109) ^ref-37220

---
Even the most pleasant sensations have a tinge of misery to them, not only because they end, but also due to the strange way we hold our minds to create a sense of a stable self in a changing world, so look for it at the level of bare experience. — location: [1113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1113) ^ref-20311

---
Just knowing in each instant how you know that pain is dissatisfactory and miserable can be profound practice. — location: [1116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1116) ^ref-65334

---
Emptiness, for all its mysterious-sounding connotations, means that reality is empty of, devoid of, or lacking a permanent, separate, independent, acausal, autonomous self. It doesn't mean that reality is not there, but that reality is not there in the way it may appear to us to be. Solidity and permanence are mistaken perceptions. That the “watcher” (whatever seems to be observing things, aka the “perceiving subject”) is a thing separable and independent from what is perceived is mistaken. However, all of this is not merely an illusion, though how the “watcher” is perceived and how sensate experience is interpreted initially is clearly delusional, as good practice eventually may reveal. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1124) ^ref-57897

---
One of my teachers wisely said, “If you are observing it, then by definition it isn't you.” Notice that all of what we call “reality” seems to be something we can observe. The hints don't get any better than this. — location: [1163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1163) ^ref-56623

---
There are absolutely no sensations that can observe other sensations. (Notice that your experiential reality is made up entirely of sensations.) There are no special sensations that are uniquely in control of other sensations. There are no sensations that are fundamentally split off or separable from other sensations occurring at that moment. To begin to unravel this mystery through the development of better perceptual skills is to begin to awaken. Simply put, reality with a sense of a separate watcher is delusion, and reality just as it is, is awakening. With systematic debunking through insight practices of the illusion of some sense of a permanent, separate, independently existing self, we learn to perceive things as they are naturally. — location: [1165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1165) ^ref-50250

---
When we get good at perceiving them all as they are, including everything that typically seems to be on “this side”, the whole thing can flip around, and suddenly all the sensations that seemed to be a “self” or property of that “self” are perceived as just sensations—natural, causal, transient—and not a self or permanent thing at all. In fact, they never were, and this can be clearly perceived by skilled practitioners. It is in some ways very much like the classic drawing by William Ely Hill that can be viewed two ways, either as a young woman or as an old woman. Whichever you see first tends to stick in your mind and then it can be tricky to see the other one until someone points out the features that make up the other face, and then suddenly you see the same set of lines in a totally different way. Insight practices create effects very much like that: same sensations, totally different implications. — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1175) ^ref-27399

It's not that the constellation labeled “me”, or “you”, a grouping of physical and mental components, does not exist and function in some ordinary sense.

Another very important, related thing: the creation of the sense of an ultimate, permanent, continuous, stable self is a process of identification, not a stable entity in and of itself.

Any thoughts with “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine” in them should be understood to be just thoughts that come and go. They are simply qualities of manifestation, like flavors of ice cream. It is not that chocolate is good and vanilla is bad; all flavors of experience are just flavors, and sometimes the flavor of the moment is “I”, “me”, “mine”, and the like, and even those flavors don't constitute a real “I”, “me”, or “mine”.

A useful teaching is conceptualizing reality as six sense doors: touch, taste, seeing, hearing, smelling, and thought.

As we apply effort to practice and build concentration, our mind will grow stronger. This in general is a great thing, but can also have a downside, which is that however we happen to be when our mind is more energetic and concentrated is written more strongly into our brain, and thus our habits and personality. Therefore, when cultivating an energetic and concentrated mind, guard it well and direct it to skillful practices and ways of being so that skillfulness is written deep into the mind, rather than things like rage, jealousy, terror, or conceit. Do not allow the mind to go down unskillful tracks and channels for longer than it takes to honestly recognize that it is doing that, or those harmful mental habits and tendencies will be written in your mind with that same power. — location: [1322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1322) ^ref-31541

---
Thus, when practicing, particularly on retreat, but also in daily life, be careful and respectful of the power of an energetic and concentrated mind. Use it skillfully, just as you would any powerful tool. Imagine that a very strong mind is like an acetylene cutting torch—useful for cutting through things (like delusion), yet capable of hurting self and others if not properly handled. Keep this analogy in mind, remember training in morality, and you will likely do much better in your practice. — location: [1332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1332) ^ref-40897

If you are trying to perceive the sensations that make up your experience clearly and to know what they are, you are balancing energy and concentration, and faith and wisdom. Due to energy, the mind is alert and attentive. Due to concentration, it is stable.

The five spiritual faculties have also been presented in another order that can be useful: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. In this order, they apply to each of the three trainings, the first of which, as discussed earlier, is morality. We have faith that training in morality is a good idea and that we can do it, so we exert energy to live up to a standard of clear and skillful living. We realize that we must pay attention to our thoughts, words, and deeds in order to do this, so we try to be mindful of them. We realize that we often fail to pay attention, so we try to increase our ability to concentrate on how we live our life. In this way, through experience, we become wiser in a relative sense, learning how to live a good and useful life. Seeing our skill improve and the benefits it has for our life, we generate more faith, and so on. — location: [1348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1348) ^ref-13789

---
With respect to training in concentration, we may have faith that we might be able to attain high states of consciousness, so we sit down on a cushion and energetically try to stabilize our attention and tune in to skillful qualities. We realize that we cannot stabilize our attention without mindfulness of our object and of the qualities of the state we wish attain. We develop strong concentration by consistently stabilizing our attention. We attain high states of concentration and thus gain a direct understanding of how to navigate in that territory and the meaning and purpose of doing so. Our success creates more faith, and so we apply energy to further develop our concentration abilities. — location: [1354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1354) ^ref-13742

---
With the faith borne of the experience yielded by strong concentration, we begin to think it might be possible to awaken, so we energetically explore all the sensations that make up our world. With an alert and energetic mind, we mindfully explore this heart, mind, and body just as it is now. Reality becomes more and more interesting, so our concentration grows, and this combination of the first four produces fundamental wisdom. Wisdom leads to more faith, and the cycle goes around again. — location: [1359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1359) ^ref-39423

Here are some valuable tips for successful noting: Don't get too neurotic about whether you have exactly the correct noting label for what arises. Stick to simple noting and move on. Noting should be as consistent and continuous as possible, perhaps one to five times per second (speed and an ability to keep noting no matter what arises are very important). Anything that derails your noting practice deserves fearless noting the next time it arises. Note honestly and precisely. — location: [1423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1423) ^ref-15090

The seemingly huge aliens that take multiple hits to kill are our own big issues, those things that are difficult for us to break into their composite sensations, termed “bosses” in video game parlance.

Natural wonder really helps many things, including and specifically investigation. Reality is simply amazing. Our minds are amazing. The vast intricacy of what happens in each moment is truly remarkable. When you sit, sit with amazement at what is going on, like a vast, complex, rich work of moving, fluxing art. When you walk, walk with a sense of wonder at all the little aspects of movement, of balancing, of a body moving through the air, through a changing landscape, with all the little facets that make that up. The feel of our foot touching the floor, earth, sand, grass, moss, leaves, stones, or whatever we are walking on is simply amazing. Air is amazing. Breathing is amazing. That we think is amazing. Food is amazing. Have you really looked at a glass of water lately? When tasting, smelling, hearing, seeing, feeling, thinking, speaking, eating, and doing anything else, really tune in to how fascinating it is to perceive all these things. This natural curiosity, this enchantment with the experience of the ordinary world, is total gold. — location: [1567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1567) ^ref-57102

All the strange physical sensations, pains, pleasures, movements, visions, lights, perception distortions, energetic phenomena, muscle tensions, etc., which may or may not show up as a result of spiritual practice are all just raptures. Repeat, just raptures. Don't get hung up on them or spin stories out of them, as compelling as they can be, and don't think that they are required or a mark of authenticity or spiritual superiority either: they are not. The sensations that make them up come, go, don't satisfy, and ain't you. Most are just byproducts of meditation and strong concentration. Some produce zero wisdom. Some can be disorienting and troubling. Some, of course, can provide deep insights into the truth of things, but don't get stuck on these. Many of these lessons show up once and never again. — location: [1583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1583) ^ref-53101

Some people can get so serious and fixated on suffering that they fight the pleasant raptures and even cling to the difficult ones. Don't do this! The joy and pleasure that may arise in meditation have wonderful healing aspects to them, and can lead to deep tranquility, concentration, and equanimity, which are all good things that support further practice. On the other hand, you don't want to cling to pleasant states either, as you will just get stuck and be frustrated when they end, which they always do. — location: [1589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1589) ^ref-43918

Equanimity also relates to a lack of struggle even when struggling, to effortlessness even in effort, to peacefulness even when there is no tranquility. When equanimity is well developed, we are not frightened of being afraid, concerned by being worried, irritated by being annoyed, pissed off by being angry, etc. Phenomena do not disturb space or even fundamentally disturb themselves from a certain point of view. I have wept and yet been very equanimous about it, if that helps clarify what I am talking about.

Check out the YouTube videos of Ayya Tathaaloka, as that's the good stuff. Being influenced by gentler approaches really helped me with the equanimity part of the equation, which was not my forte, and I recommend that you find something for yourself that serves to balance my vibe. Looking back, I feel that balancing my practice by exposure to these sorts of influences facilitated a settling into what was happening naturally, and that my practice would have been much more difficult without exposure to that sort of gentler — location: [1657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1657) ^ref-43630

Once again, we are back to knowing this moment just as it is. This “just as it is” quality is related to mindfulness and to equanimity. In the end, we must accept the truth of our specific lives, of our minds, of our neuroses, of our “defilements”, of impermanence, of suffering, and of emptiness. We must accept this, and this is what they are talking about when they say just “open to it”, “be with it”, “let it be”, “let it go”, and so on. — location: [1661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1661) ^ref-54602

Reflect on these previous three paragraphs now and often, as many errors on the spiritual path come from not understanding the points made therein. Too often there is an imbalance between the first three (mindfulness, investigation, and energy), and the last three (tranquility, concentration, and equanimity). Most aspiring insight meditators are, to be honest, way too slack about the first three. Just so, some gung-ho meditators like the people who have tended to be attracted to this book may get into trouble when they don't cultivate enough acceptance, balance, and peace, related to the last three. When people focus for too long only on the middle factor, rapture, they become bliss-junkies. When they fail to include rapture in their practice, they often get darker and gloomier despite otherwise good effort. In short, it is critical to cultivate all seven factors. — location: [1677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1677) ^ref-60796

If you are frying yourself on the path of insight, as evidenced by becoming uptight, wound up, reactive, cranky, angry, frustrated, edgy, or nervous, then it is time to ease up, back off, learn concentration practices, do some loving-kindness or similar practices (described later), and cultivate the skillful aspects of the last three factors and perhaps a bit more rapture in the “stop and smell the roses” sense. Many hardcore meditators will ignore this piece of advice to their detriment, assuming it is only by being plugged into 100,000 volts and flipping on the big switch that anything good will ever happen. Numerous points along the way should help elucidate how to find this balance and the markers of progress versus being stuck. — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1686) ^ref-29438

One last thing about equanimity: its near enemy, its deadening impostor, is indifference or apathy. Real equanimity is accepting the full range of the heart and experience, whereas indifference is dry, flat, chilly, dissociative, robotic, and heartless. Real equanimity is extremely honest about what is going on. It is very human, very down-to-earth, very full-spectrum, and very ordinary in most ways. This point is frequently misunderstood. However, being accepting of the full range of the heart doesn't mean acting on whatever impulse comes up. Act only on the impulses of the heart that seem genuinely skillful and kind. Real equanimity is even accepting of the fluxing sensations that make up flatness, strangely enough, but it is more honest about them. This is a fine line, but the point remains. — location: [1692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1692) ^ref-56751

To balance and perfect the seven factors of awakening is sufficient cause for awakening. Thus, checking in from time to time with this list and seeing how you are doing and what might need improvement is a good idea. Just having this list in the back of your mind can be helpful. Furthermore, the seven factors of awakening make for great meditation description and categorization that guides the process of self-correction. — location: [1704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1704) ^ref-20460

For example, we might say, “That last sit was characterized by a moderate degree of mindfulness, a pretty high degree of investigation, moderate energy, not very good rapture, poor tranquility, moderately good concentration, and a pretty low degree of equanimity.” — location: [1707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1707) ^ref-30737

It is important to note that only one of the seven factors, namely investigation of the three characteristics, distinguishes training in concentration from training in fundamental insight. — location: [1717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1717) ^ref-28456

Just to review, the scope of the first training, morality, is the ordinary world, the conventional world, the world that we are all familiar with before we even consider more specialized topics such as meditation. The goal is to think, speak, and act in ways that are conducive to the reduction of suffering as well as the welfare of ourselves and others. The scope of the second training, concentration, is to focus on very specific and limited objects of meditation and thus attain specific altered states of consciousness that cultivate positive mental qualities and reduce negative ones. The scope of the third training, that of insight or wisdom, is to shift to perceiving reality at the level of individual sensations, perceive their three characteristics, and thus attain profound insights into the nature of reality and realize stages of awakening. — location: [1746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1746) ^ref-59265

---
There is also the type of renunciation associated with insight practices, in which we are willing to break from the gross conceptual way of working that is helpful for the scope of the ordinary world, break from the more restricted and refined conceptual and attentional way of working that is necessary to attain stable concentration, and move to perceiving sensations individually and directly, seeing their true nature, however they may present. It is a radical antithesis to the way that some might conceive of renunciation, which can sometimes become aversive, as it involves a commitment to being here, in this body, in this space, in this life, at this time, and making this radical commitment again and again. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1780) ^ref-47947

---
While “awakening” generally sounds very appealing, it suddenly sounds strange in the context of seeing all sensations as being utterly transient, a source of pain if we make artificial dualities out of them, and if we mistake transient sensations for an experientially stable, independent self. — location: [1786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1786) ^ref-23310

For example, rather than popping a cold beer at the end of a hard day, we could sit down and bathe our body and mind in as much healing bliss and peace as we can stand for as long as we wish. If we master concentration practices, we have those options. — location: [1823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1823) ^ref-16311

---
Rather, I define awakening as permanently eliminating the basic perceptions that either duality or unity is the answer, and thus attaining to permanent realizations that are unshakable within the limits of biology. Awakening has nothing whatsoever to do with how things manifest and everything to do with basic understanding of those things. — location: [1840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1840) ^ref-60165

When doing insight practices, it doesn't matter so much if thoughts of past or future arise, so long as we are not fascinated by their content, notice that the experiences of thoughts occur now, and notice the true nature of the individual sensations that make up those thoughts. — location: [1849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1849) ^ref-43995

Why do we practice? We're dissatisfied, we hurt, we sense there must be something greater, or a better way to address suffering, or we can no longer lie to ourselves about our situation and the stark predicament of what awaits us if it isn't here yet, such as sickness, aging, and death. It is just that simple. — location: [1925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1925) ^ref-50237

At the most fundamental level, which is the most useful for doing insight practices, at some habitual level, we wish desperately that there was some separate, permanent self, and we spend huge amounts of time doing our best to prop up this illusion. This consumes surprising amounts of mental processing power. However, this wish for a stable “this” side, a stable observer, a stable “me” is largely unconscious initially. Our job is to make it conscious so we can see what it is doing and how that feels. For this largely unconscious process to function, we habitually ignore much useful sensate information about our reality and invest our mental impressions and simplifications of reality with more power and importance than they necessarily have. It is this illusion that adds a problematic element to the normal and understandable ways in which we go about trying to be happy. We constantly struggle with reality because we misunderstand it, that is, because reality misunderstands itself. — location: [1938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1938) ^ref-12956

They don't realize that things on the cushion tend to get worse before they get better. Thus, they get nowhere, as they reject the very truths they must deeply understand to obtain the peace they are seeking. They reject the valid insights that they themselves have gained through valid practice.

---
There is a flip side to suffering that can help, and that is compassion, the wish to be free of suffering. Wherever there is suffering there is compassion, though most of the time it is distorted by the confused logic of the process of identification and illusory separation which is based on poor perception. — location: [1956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1956) ^ref-52364

---
The second noble truth is the cause of suffering, in Pali tanha, variously translated as desire, craving, clinging, grasping, fixating, or attachment. These translations are mostly inadequate, but they are getting at something. From a relative perspective, we hang on to what is pleasurable and try to avoid or push away what interrupts that pleasure. We want things to be other than they are because we perceive the world through the odd paradigm of the illusion of the split of the perceiver and the perceived. — location: [1960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1960) ^ref-56136

---
But if common sense is ignored, craving non-craving can produce a refined yet toxic aversion that produces neurotic, self-righteous, repressed ascetics instead of balanced, kind meditators. — location: [1967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1967) ^ref-19052

---
As stated earlier, a helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice and of reality related to kindness. You see, wherever there is desire there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is compassion, the desire for the end of our own and others’ suffering. You can experience this. There is a close relationship between suffering, desire, and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and worth investigating. — location: [1977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1977) ^ref-31941

---
We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dog chasing its tail. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be “over there”. Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there, to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the illusory sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. — location: [1981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1981) ^ref-60370

---
When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from “there” (or even “here”), a mental pressure that attempts to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because the split doesn't exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful, and this is fundamental aversion. — location: [1985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1985) ^ref-28640

---
When boring or apparently uninteresting sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out altogether and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the imagined split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place. — location: [1988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1988) ^ref-50555

---
These strict definitions of fundamental attraction, aversion, and ignorance are very important, particularly for when I discuss the various models of the stages of awakening. Given the illusion, it seems that these unskillful mental reactions will help in a lasting way. Remember that the only thing that will fundamentally help is to understand the three characteristics to the degree that makes the difference, and the three characteristics are manifesting right here. — location: [1991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1991) ^ref-7292

Do you remember reading above that suffering motivates everything we do? We could also say that everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part of the fundamentally empty nature of reality.

The wisdom section has the two last parts of the path: right view and right intention.

From a pure insight perspective, neither one is more holy or more of a source of truth than the other, but when we do the experiment we will quickly realize what works for us. “Works” in this case means that we can keep up being able to see the true nature of the numerous quick sensations that make up our reality. — location: [2097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2097) ^ref-47445

If you want to build momentum, don't take pauses in the practice, as they will cost you much more than you think they could. Stopping for ten minutes to slack off after an hour sit might cost you all the momentum you gained during that sit and perhaps more! Be mindful every friggin’ second from the moment you get up to the moment you go to sleep and in all transition periods—getting up off the cushion, brushing your teeth, walking to the meditation hall, eating, bathing, peeing, dressing, etc.—those who make use of every moment and every context will make vastly more progress, on average, than those who don't, even if those other people are still doing the same walking and sitting sessions.

Do not underestimate walking meditation.

I have found it extremely valuable, particularly when sitting down to do formal meditation, to state to myself at the beginning of the session exactly what I am doing, what I hope to attain by it, and why attaining that is a good idea. I do this formally and clearly, either aloud or silently to myself. Having done practice with and without such resolutions, I have come to the definite conclusion that they can make a huge difference in my practice. One of my favorite resolutions goes something like this: I resolve that for this hour I will consistently investigate the sensations that make up reality to attain to liberating insights for the benefit of myself and all beings. — location: [2728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2728) ^ref-63208

I was at one of these small group meetings where everyone was talking about their neurotic stuff. In a moment of feeling like I might be able to add something useful, I said in a loud and exasperated voice, “The breath! Is anyone trying to notice the breath?” They just looked at me like I was out of my mind and went back to whining about their psychological issues. Here was a roomful of otherwise accomplished adults who somehow had been functionally transformed into needy and pathetic children without any obvious ability to deal with their lives or follow very basic instructions. Beware of meditation cultures that consistently encourage this in people. It is a mark of something gone horribly wrong. — location: [2932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2932) ^ref-30548

My emphasis on also making time for insight practices is to counterbalance the general trend for most insight practitioners’ practice to be almost entirely about moderately neurotic, largely ineffective, spiritually rationalized, hyper-idealistic wallowing in their emotional pain or attempting to bypass it altogether in a blinding golden haze of Buddhist-inspired fantasy. This sort of practice often impairs both real psychological and emotional maturation and deep insight. — location: [2959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2959) ^ref-31196

If we would just go into finely discerned sensate reality and try to see the three characteristics of each sensation that makes up experience, we might begin to understand reality at a level that makes the difference. Effectively encouraging students to shift their attention from fixation on and identification with content to working with direct experience as it arises is probably the hardest yet most important job of the meditation teacher. I sometimes wonder how many teachers have mostly given up trying to do this. — location: [2977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2977) ^ref-44001

---
When we meditators on retreat focus on content instead of on grounding the mind in the objects of meditation (which just might produce the deep insights that will make the big difference we seek), we basically let our minds go, and go they do. — location: [2980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2980) ^ref-55905

---
Years go by, and our practice “deepens”, not into insight territory, but into epoxy-like faith in and further fixation on content. We learn how to “talk Buddhist”. We learn the culture of Buddhism in just the same way that we learned the culture of transpersonal therapy, transactional analysis, or French existentialism. We become fascinated with our growing knowledge of Pali, our fancy brass bell from Nepal, or our knowledge of tantric iconography. We have taken bodhisattva vows 108 times. — location: [2986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2986) ^ref-54667

Thus, most teachers won't say something as straightforward as, “Well, when I was meditating, I spent some time lost in the stories and tape-loops of my mind. This was terrible and I got nowhere but nutty. However, one day a senior teacher straightened me out and convinced me to ground my mind in the specific sensations that make up the objects of meditation and examine impermanence. After some days of consistent and diligent practice using correct technique, I began to directly penetrate the three illusions of permanence, satisfactoriness, and self, and my world began to be broken down into the mind-moments and vibrations that I always thought were just talk. By paying careful attention to bare phenomena arising and passing moment after quick moment, I progressively moved through the stages of insight and got my first taste of awakening. Thus, if you spin in content and don't realize the three characteristics, you are wasting your time and mine. This is just the way it is. If you develop strong concentration on the primary object and investigate the three characteristics consistently, this will almost certainly produce insight. This is just the way it is. Any questions?” — location: [3024](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3024) ^ref-62374

---
A quick digression here: awakening is about understanding the fundamental nature of all sensate experiences, and what they happen to be is ultimately completely and utterly irrelevant to awakening. Thus, very awakened beings understand something fundamental about whatever arises or however their lives manifest, that is, its impermanence, emptiness, luminosity, groundlessness, or however they wish to describe it. However, they have no more knowledge about the specifics of the world than they have acquired in just the way that anyone else acquires knowledge about the specifics of this world. They can even have all sorts of psychological baggage to deal with, and this is probably the norm. — location: [3056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3056) ^ref-16059

Further, we may not gain the benefits of the only thing that does make a lasting difference in ending fundamental suffering and bringing the quiet joy of understanding, which is mastery of insight practice and thus awakening. — location: [3077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3077) ^ref-25386

---
a dangerous notion that pervades many spiritual circles is that it is bad to want to awaken, and that no discipline, effort, or application of a technique could produce awakening. These notions are completely absurd and have paralyzed or preempted the practice of far too many. I believe these ideas have come from an extremely confused misunderstanding of causality and of the “sudden” and “gradual” schools of thought. “Sudden awakening” is exceedingly rare, and, I will claim, had to involve prior effort and specific prior causes, even if the practitioner doesn't subsequently remember or recognize what those causes were or the effort that was exerted. Anyone who has really gotten into any Buddhist teachings, whether Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana, will know firsthand that all require a tremendous amount of effort just like every other spiritual path. — location: [3079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3079) ^ref-54606

---
As one of my teacher's teachers put it, “In the end, you must give up even the desire for awakening, but not too soon!” Sutta 131 in the Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha (MN 131) is called “One Fortunate Attachment”, and in it the Buddha clearly states that making effort to realize the truth of your experience is an extremely good idea. He also goes on and on about the three characteristics—fancy that! — location: [3086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3086) ^ref-40358

---
There is no such thing as the breath or an image of Green Tara from the point of view of insight practices, as these are just fresh streams of impermanent and transient sensations that are crudely labeled “breath” or “Green Tara”. But, for developing the second training of concentration, we ignore impermanence and instead give everything to the specific sensations that make up the breath, or a mantra, or an image, and cultivate attention to those and the positive mental qualities that arise in strong concentration. Thus, even for pure concentration practice, the specifics of what you are concentrating on matter. — location: [3099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3099) ^ref-51451

---
However, when it comes to insight practice, fixation on content must be suspended during that practice session. In insight practice, everything a practitioner has learned about being lost in the names of things and thoughts about them, i.e. content, will be not only completely useless, but an obstacle preventing realization. Here the inquiry must turn to the six sense doors and to impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self. These characteristics must be realized clearly and directly in whatever sensations arise, be they pleasant, painful, beautiful, ugly, helpful, unhelpful, skillful, unskillful, holy, profane, dull, or otherwise. Anything other than this is just not insight practice, never was, and never will be. — location: [3104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3104) ^ref-2239

---
It doesn't matter what the quality of your mind is, or what the sensations of your body are; if you directly understand the momentary sensations that make these up to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not a self or the property of any self, then you are on the right path, the path of liberating insight. — location: [3109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3109) ^ref-40738

It can help to consider that to completely understand compassion is to understand suffering and vice versa, as these are really two sides of the same coin.

One of the clear marks of whether insight practices are appropriate for a given individual is simply that person's ability to do them after having properly understood the instructions on how to do them. If, despite clear instructions and appropriate support, a would-be insight meditator is simply unable to do anything but mentally spin in content, “processing”, and fixation, they should dedicate themselves to carefully cultivating ethical conduct through at least observance of the five precepts until they can hear, understand, and then follow the extremely basic yet precise instructions of insight practices. The Buddha iterated and reiterated that the first training of morality forms the foundation for the latter two trainings. — location: [3166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3166) ^ref-39757

I do not write this lightly. It is vital that your motivation be as clearly understood as possible and that all its energy be channeled into realizing your goals.

Thus, don't look out there except to find wise guidance about how to look in here, for what you are looking for is “nearer than near”. It is in the looking. It is in the motivation.

Awakening arises only when the level of basic sensate clarity is developed enough, which usually takes lots of work, and the heart accepting enough of things as they are.

---
the very sense of a drive to find something is the thing it is seeking. The motivation is looking for itself. In those sensations is something very powerful and amazing if they are clearly comprehended. However, to see this, a shift must happen in which the drive becomes driven to understand the sensations of that drive itself rather than looking to future sensations for satisfaction and understanding. As straightforward as that sounds, it is a completely unintuitive thing to do, and this is one reason that meditation practices can seem so awkward at times. — location: [3233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3233) ^ref-19879

Thus, if you feel frustrated that your practice has not been as energized or as clear as you wish it to be, first sit with the sensations of the urgency of that wish, with the fullness of that frustration, with the fullness of your fears, your hopes, with the fullness of that suffering and compassion, as clearly and bravely as you possibly can until you understand them to their very depths as they are.

We could simply wish to understand deeply the true nature of the sensations that make up our world as they naturally arise and vanish in that practice session or throughout that day.

Thoughts of the past and future occur only in the present, which is natural and straightforward. These sensations are worthy of investigation. “Future mind” is only a problem if the sensations that make it up are not understood as they are. A fun practice to try is to think consciously those thoughts whose content is purely past- or future-oriented. Notice that they are occurring now and are part of this sense-field, this space here and now. There is something profound about this sort of practice that might be missed on first inspection, and doing this well enough can deconstruct how the sense of time is created, which is liberating in and of itself. — location: [3261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3261) ^ref-45268

It is also worth keeping in the front of your mind the three characteristics, the most profound and important of which is no-self, meaning that all phenomena occur interdependently, causally, naturally, and lawfully. By remembering this essential characteristic and keeping it in our minds, we can notice that reality already shows up with comprehension built right into sensations. Sit quietly and notice this most fundamental and liberating aspect of things again and again, realizing that just sitting involves sensations, and each of these sensations is naturally revealing its true nature. Return to this paragraph when you feel you are frying yourself and read it a bunch of times to help it sink in as, strangely, this very easy and natural message can be a hard one to really integrate. — location: [3266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3266) ^ref-54568

Thus, my advice when on an insight meditation retreat is to power the investigation skillfully all day long, whether you are sitting, walking, reclining, standing, eating, washing, etc., until you get stable enough to realize that reality is happening on its own and just gently be with that.

While some students of Buddhism can fixate on the loathsomeness of the body, it is the vehicle we ride to awakening, so care for it appropriately. As spending years working in emergency departments has taught me, by showing me both what people who live long, happy lives do, and also what happens when people do otherwise, your best hope for good physical outcomes results from putting good, nourishing things in your mouth in moderate quantities, avoiding putting bad things in your mouth, exercising in non-damaging ways, driving safely, getting enough sleep, reducing stress, having a good attitude about life, having meaningful things to do with your time, and having good social support. — location: [3321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3321) ^ref-26597

I heard someone speculating that Zen might have developed as being very austere, strict, and drab because of how colorful and unstable Japan was during its development, and likewise the Tibetan tradition was very colorful and complex because much of the landscape of Tibet was so alienating and bleak. Burmese Buddhism might be so extremely technical, goal-oriented, straightforward, empowering, and efficient because their country is such a chaotic mess politically. Perhaps in just this way, those of us in Europe and North America have some of the most goal-oriented, workaholic cultures in the world and yet tend towards the least goal-oriented, least practical, and least effective take on Buddhism I have found anywhere. — location: [3335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3335) ^ref-9499

It is common for people to feel badly about their lack of perceived progress. This can cause extreme frustration, self-judgment, self-hatred, jealousy, depression, extremes of blind faith, and rigid adherence to dogma.

Simply allow yourself to examine the sensations that make up this frustration, self-condemnation, depression, and jealousy, etc. In other words, don't stop investigating when certain categories of sensations arise.

If we are going to take on feelings at a more formal vipassana level, we might try identifying a feeling we wish to clarify and get to know more skillfully.

At least in theory, concentration practices are meditations on a concept or a seemingly continuous aggregate of many transient sensations, whereas insight practice is meditation on the transient sensations as they are. — location: [3682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3682) ^ref-64323

When doing concentration practices, we consciously focus our attention in a specific concentration state. While reality cannot be frozen in this way, the illusion of solidity, continuity, and stability certainly can be cultivated to still attention. This is concentration practice. — location: [3683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3683) ^ref-44233

All the concentration states strengthen, stabilize, steady, and calm the mind, and this has four primary benefits. — location: [3718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3718) ^ref-43792

First, just as a video camera that is shaking wildly cannot produce a clearly visible video, so a mind that can't remain settled on an object will not clearly perceive its ultimate truth. — location: [3718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3718) ^ref-2412

---
Second, as concentration states cultivate deep clarity and stability on content, albeit very refined content, they are very useful for promoting deep healing and psychological insights. In other words, if you want to become aware of your stuff, do concentration practices, particularly with a focus on mental objects such as mantras rather than physical ones such as the breath, not that breath-based meditations can't also bring up our psychological issues. — location: [3720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3720) ^ref-2938

---
Third, concentration states can be a welcome and valid vacation from stress, providing periods of profound relaxation and peace that can be an extremely important part of a sane, compassionate, and healthy lifestyle. Concentration states temporarily suppress the hindrances, all of which are stressful. Temporarily suppressing the hindrances in this way is considered extremely skillful. The Buddha highly praised those who had mastery of the concentration states, and this should serve as a reminder to those who dismiss or underestimate their great value or mistakenly feel that enjoying our life is somehow “unspiritual”. — location: [3723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3723) ^ref-24436

---
Fourth, concentration practices can help insight practitioners maintain powerful mental stability as old habitual concepts about themselves and all existence are dismantled and razed by insight practice. However, if these concentration states end up blocking our ability to gain insight, by solidifying a sense of self, or creating aversion to experience suffering clearly, then they can become a significant and dangerously lofty kind of hindrance. Pleasurable hindrances that come from spiritual practice are traditionally referred to as “golden chains”. — location: [3728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3728) ^ref-41694

Notice that if we are spinning lost in thought, decent concentration is basically impossible. If you wish to attain this, I would try to stay as completely as possible with a chosen meditation object for perhaps one minute. When you can do this, try for ten minutes. When you can do this, try for an hour. For instance, if you were using the breath as an object, try to be aware of every single breath at least in part for a full ten minutes, and then for an hour. This is possible, and a reasonable goal. — location: [4001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4001) ^ref-20069

---
Try not to pay too much attention to the individual sensations themselves, but conceptualize the breath as a coherent and continuous entity, with many different types of sensations all being thought of as being the breath. It is important to know that really getting into a sense of the breath as a continuous entity for ten seconds will do you more good than being with the breath on and off for an hour. — location: [4004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4004) ^ref-56944

Tune in to the illusory smoothness of things by purposefully and calmly working with illusions of solidity or fluidity. There is a certain “into it” quality which helps, sort of like really getting into a slow groove when playing an instrument, having sex, playing a sport, or just sinking into a well-deserved warm bubble bath. That, “Oh, yeah, baby, just like that!” vibe is exactly what you are looking for, at least initially. When doing concentration… — location: [4007](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4007) ^ref-19740

Merely concentrating is not necessarily sufficient to get us into jhana, though it helps and may cause it to arise naturally; but for some it takes inclination in the direction of jhana, intending to go that way, so knowing the general qualities you are looking for helps with that inclination. Sensations that feel good naturally reinforce concentration, so use that feedback loop of feeling good leading to paying more attention, which leads to better concentration, which leads to feeling even better, which leads to paying even more attention. Being in a silent and safe place is also very conducive, as is giving yourself permission to relax, put the cares of the world behind you, and enjoy. Concentration practice benefits greatly from optimal conditions. That said, some of us, like myself, are more aversive types, and pleasure, while fun enough, doesn't hold my attention as well as it does for some others. I personally find that secluding the mind from disturbing or unpleasant sensations by tuning attention away from them and towards stillness and stability of attention can sometimes be a good strategy for working with my more aversive nature, as that turning away from everything that is not jhana is also a way into jhana. You will have to see what works best for you and your personality makeup.3 Comfort in posture is important also, as pain makes getting into these states more difficult. A strongly concentrated mind can overcome and eventually entirely block out pain. While it is possible to get into blissful and peaceful states while in painful physical positions, I don't see the point in doing… — location: [4011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4011) ^ref-2060

Back to the instructions: if you are using the breath as your primary meditation object, you might try purposefully visualizing it as sweet, smooth waves or circles that are peaceful and welcome. Try breathing as if you were in a garden of fragrant roses and you wish to experience the fullness of their fragrance. — location: [4047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4047) ^ref-37195

Some degree of stagnation is guaranteed in insight practice if you cling in this way to pleasant sensations, or anything else for that matter. In other words, if you fail to truly perceive the impermanence of all phenomena that make up your subjective experience, you will have artificially solidified them (“clung to” them in the standard yet not-very-precise parlance) and you will not gain clear insight into the way they occur. — location: [4111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4111) ^ref-52862
