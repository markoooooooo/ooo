## Highlights
As the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer put it: “The task is … not so much to see what no one has yet seen; but to think what nobody has yet thought, about that which everybody sees.”1 — location: [141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=141) ^ref-8575

---
This construction is perfectly sensible, and accords with your intuition. Yet the universal now, the set of all events everywhere that are happening at the same moment as you read this—so clear in your mind—is just a dream. — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=771) ^ref-1508

You are made of particles. You, and all your component particles, are choosing directions right now. Which path will you look back and realize you always have been taking? — location: [1015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1015) ^ref-49607

---
The claim is that the seeming diversity of forces is largely an illusion. Essentially all of the nongravitational forces that we experience in the everyday world are really manifestations of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell’s equations. — location: [1205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1205) ^ref-3045

---
When a substance—solid, liquid, or gas—applies a force to you by pushing or rubbing, it can be meaningfully thought of as the electric forces between the atoms composing that substance and those composing you. — location: [1209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1209) ^ref-15261

---
In this description, then, all of the relevant forces essentially boil down to gravity, caused by the distribution of matter, and electromagnetism, caused by the distribution of charges.* — location: [1211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1211) ^ref-33597

---
“For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubborn illusion.”3 — location: [1247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1247) ^ref-9008

---
We could go still further, tracing the chemical reactions which produce the impression of this image on the retina, in the nerve tract and in the brain, and then in the end say: these chemical changes of his brain cells are perceived by the observer. —John von Neumann, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics — location: [1713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=1713) ^ref-63211

A corporeal phenomenon, a feeling, a perception, a mental formation, a consciousness, which is permanent and persistent, eternal and not subject to change, such a thing the wise men in this world do not recognize; and I also say that there is no such thing. —Shakyamuni Buddha — location: [2312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07JQDM6B3&location=2312) ^ref-2820
