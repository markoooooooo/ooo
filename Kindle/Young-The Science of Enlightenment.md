meditation elevates a person’s base level of focus. By focus, I mean the ability to attend to what’s relevant in a given situation. By base level, I mean how focused you automatically get in daily life when you’re not making an effort to be focused. If you’re consistently two or three times more focused in each moment of life, then you’re living two or three times bigger, two or three times richer. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=218) ^ref-16782

---
you can dramatically extend life—not by multiplying the number of your years, but by expanding the fullness of your moments. Knowing that I have lived with such richness makes the visage of my inevitable death less problematic. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=221) ^ref-28241

---
you can think of enlightenment as a kind of permanent shift in perspective that comes about through direct realization that there is no thing called “self” inside you. — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=236) ^ref-38238

When the sensory experience of the mind-body becomes sufficiently clear and uninhibited, it ceases to be a rigid thing that imprisons your identity. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=242) ^ref-24363

Let me be clear: enlightenment is real. Not only is it real, but it is something that can be achieved by normal human beings through the systematic practice of meditation. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=257) ^ref-32615

---
That shift did not immediately go away, even after I had completely come down from the drugs. For about two weeks, I walked around in a magic world. Prior to that, the things I had read about in my Buddhist studies seemed to me to be nothing but mythological ruminations and philosophical conjectures, elaborated by scholars with too much time on their hands. Now, for the first time, I realized that they were not just concocting speculations. They were trying to describe something that human beings actually experience. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=343) ^ref-11552

Equanimity is the ability to allow sensory experience to well up without suppression and to pass away without identifying with it. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=365) ^ref-10126

Enlightenment is not a peak from which you descend over time. It is a plateau from which you ascend, further and further as the months, years, and decades pass. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=371) ^ref-55279

“As a general principle, any positive state that you experience within the context of silent sitting practice, you must try to attain in the midst of ordinary life.” — location: [420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=420) ^ref-8343

---
He explained to me that there is a natural progression of challenges to attain this: The first is to experience some degree of samadhi during formal sitting. The next is to experience it during simple tasks like cleaning, then to maintain it during more complex tasks like cooking meals, serving guests at the temple, and so forth. The next level of challenge would be to stay in samadhi during small talk. The ultimate challenge would be to stay in samadhi while having important, emotionally charged, social interactions with others. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=422) ^ref-24639

I like to describe mindfulness as a threefold attentional skill set: concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity working together. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=563) ^ref-30873

I learned that impermanence is not merely something that you experience in your sensory circuits. It also informs your motor circuits. It’s a kind of effortless energy that you can “ride on” in daily life. It imparts a bounce to your step, a flow to your voice, and a vibrancy to your creative thought. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=583) ^ref-13844

For example, you can practice meditation while talking to someone. In fact, you could do that in a number of different ways. You can do that by intently focusing on the sights and sounds of that person—so intently focusing on those sights and sounds that you enter into what Martin Buber calls an “I-Thou” relationship with them. I call that approach Focus Out. But that’s just one way that you could meditate while talking to a person. Another way would be to monitor, in a state of high concentration, your mental and emotional reactions to that person. I call that approach Focus In. Yet another way to meditate while talking to a person would be to intentionally create lovingkindness emotion in your body and then taste an expansive flavor of concentration by spreading that pleasant body sensation out into the room, enveloping your interlocutor with love. I call that approach Nurture Positivity. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=781) ^ref-6206

---
You can also meditate while washing the dishes. You anchor yourself in the physical touch of the water and dishes, along with the sights and sounds of washing, the motion of the water, and the clacking of the dishware. You get into a zone state and become one with the water and the dishes—yet another instance of Focus Out. — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=788) ^ref-29878

---
The Focus Out approach makes it possible to enter a meditative state while driving through traffic. You put all your attention on what’s relevant to driving, such as the sights of the road, the sounds of the other cars, and the physical body sensations of driving, the touch of the steering wheel, the touch of the seat, the physical linkage to the car. That way you can enter a deep state and still be driving safely—indeed more safely than most people. In this case, your meditation practice is the way that you drive. You’re fully focused on the seeing, hearing, and feeling of the drive. — location: [791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=791) ^ref-15175

---
Rigorous research by people in the positive psychology movement has shown that a concentrated state is intrinsically rewarding, and that reward is independent of the content of one’s experience. Boring, even painful, experiences can become interesting and pleasant when experienced in a state of intense concentration. — location: [795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=795) ^ref-15386

---
So there are actually four subskills to concentration: learning how to restrict attention to small sensory events, learning how to evenly cover large sensory events, learning how to sustain concentration on one thing for an extended period of time, and learning how to taste a momentary state of concentration with whatever randomly calls your attention. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=829) ^ref-36710

The ultimate personal goal of meditation is to achieve happiness independent of conditions. — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=879) ^ref-28028

---
happiness independent of conditions occurs whenever we have a complete sensory experience. — location: [887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=887) ^ref-64896

---
To have a complete experience means to experience something in a state of extraordinary concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. Any ordinary sensory event, when experienced completely, becomes extraordinary and paradoxical: its richness is maximal but its somethingness is minimal. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=888) ^ref-23901

---
A complete experience of pleasure delivers pure satisfaction but has little substance. A complete experience of pain is deeply poignant but not problematic. A complete experience of desire is desireless. A complete experience of mental confusion nurtures intuitive wisdom. A complete experience of self convinces you there never was a self. — location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=890) ^ref-7014

---
The only way we know of a condition is through sensory experience—what we see, hear, and feel on the inside and the outside. Desirable conditions create pleasant sensory experiences. Undesirable conditions create unpleasant sensory experiences. Neutral conditions create neutral sensory experiences. But any sensory experience can, in theory, be a complete experience. And when we’re having complete experiences, we’re happy regardless of the content of the experience. — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=892) ^ref-51557

---
Complete experience is a kind of metapleasure, a pleasure that both unifies and transcends pleasure and pain. — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=896) ^ref-5498

---
So meditation is partially something you do to help yourself at many levels, including the ultimate level, which is to transcend your self. People usually identify with their thoughts and feelings, their minds and their bodies. The thinking mind and the feeling body thus become a prison within which most people spend their lives. Meditation makes it possible to transcend that limited identity, so that the mind and body become a home that you can go in and out of, rather than a prison that you are stuck in. — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=904) ^ref-19922

---
And how do you free your mind-body? By having a complete experience of your mind-body! This is one possible way of viewing the path to enlightenment. — location: [907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=907) ^ref-2179

---
That is the basic pattern on this planet: People do not understand how to experience pain fully, that is, without suffering. Suffering distorts their response to the source of the pain, and this distorted response can easily lead to more pain and, hence, more suffering. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=945) ^ref-15202

Meditation allows us to experience pain without suffering and pleasure without neediness. — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=949) ^ref-18766

Consider the situation of our remote ancestors—humans living before the development of cities, literature, and technology. Viewed from the perspective of the modern world, how would we characterize their life? It seems to me that for most of human history, life was simple, uncomfortable, and full of things that people could not understand. — location: [1209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1209) ^ref-40550

---
One natural response to physical discomfort is to find ways to get comfortable. — location: [1212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1212) ^ref-23490

---
This eventually leads to the development of complex tools, building skills, and the rise of cities, writing systems, and technology. Analogously, one response to the mystery of things is to figure out how stuff works. This eventually leads to the development of science. Thanks to centuries of research and invention, we can be comfortable in our houses even in the dead of winter, and we don’t get perplexed by phenomena such as eclipses or thunder or a woman’s menstrual cycle. However, there is another equally natural response to physical discomfort, and that is to simply open up to the discomfort rather than fight it. In the same way, instead of flailing to find answers, we can let go of the need to know and open to the mystery of things. This second response is the core of the religion of tribal peoples, usually referred to as shamanism. Shamanism is often described as an attempt to acquire power through contact with the spirit world. — location: [1212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1212) ^ref-54047

Among people who develop a high concentration through a particular secular activity, some go beyond the state of high concentration. They don’t just get completely focused when they dance, they tangibly taste a formless state of no self/big self as they dance. The dance, the dancer, and the audience all vanish into a pure doing of space. The dance continuously manifests from seedless samadhi—the Still Point of the turning world. The poet T. S. Eliot describes this beautifully: “Except for the point, the still point, / There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.” — location: [1251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1251) ^ref-32861

---
If a person enters samadhi without a seed while performing some art, they are, strictly speaking, no longer performing. The universe itself is manifesting through their art. If they’re able to replicate that state in daily life, then their sport or art can be legitimately described as a path to enlightenment. — location: [1255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1255) ^ref-15069

One of the main creators of Noh acting theory, Zeami Motokiyo, talked about what he called the “Flower.” According to him, the Flower is the absolute epitome of art, and very few people ever reach it. The Flower is what happens when rigorous training, intrinsic talent, and deep no self come together. The art is no longer a creation, it’s a manifestation. — location: [1261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1261) ^ref-11029

That’s when I started to notice something amusing. For me, coffee is a natural complement to meditation, because it helps to keep you alert. When I think of coffee, I think about how it makes my mind clear. This parallels tea, which was introduced into Japan by Zen monks to help them remain awake during long periods of meditation. — location: [1309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1309) ^ref-369

---
While concentrating and calming down is certainly a part of meditation, it is only half of the story. The other half of the process is clarifying, that is, observing, analyzing, and deconstructing sensory experience. Clarifying leads to insight. — location: [1315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1315) ^ref-21889

---
One way to think about meditation is as a dialectical interplay between a calming-concentrating aspect (samatha) and a clarifying-dissecting aspect (vipassana). For simplicity, I’ll just call these two sides of meditation the calming part and the clarifying part. — location: [1317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1317) ^ref-22462

And then something dramatic happened. I dropped into a stunningly altered state which I had never experienced before. I noticed that the pain was exactly the same, but it didn’t bother me anymore. It just felt like flowing energy. The voice inside my head totally stopped for the first time in my whole life. I actually observed this shift taking place. First my mental voice was screaming at the top of its lungs, then it was just talking in a normal voice. Then it turned into a whisper, then it turned into a faint little hint. And then there was silence. I had never in my entire life had the experience of inner silence. It was absolutely worth every minute of the pain, because from that time on, I knew what it was like to hear the absence of chatter in my head. — location: [1347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1347) ^ref-54543

---
I call this approach Focus on Rest. You let your attention move between visual rest (darkness/brightness behind your closed eyes or defocused external gaze), auditory rest (mental quiet or physical silence), and somatic rest (physical relaxation and emotional tranquility). — location: [1368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1368) ^ref-44228

---
There are two main traps that prevent people from reaching their fullest potential on the meditative path. The first is mistaking the map for the journey. Thinking about and debating about the paths becomes a substitute for systematically practicing a path. The second common trap is getting caught in a good place: the path leads to something good, but growth slows after that. — location: [1380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1380) ^ref-58337

Even though Siddhartha Gautama lived about twenty-five hundred years ago, he was, essentially, a modern person in many ways. He was a rationalist, he downplayed the role of authority, and he was critical of the inequities of the caste system as it existed then. — location: [1394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1394) ^ref-62877

---
He was the only religious leader in the history of the world who asked people not to follow his teachings based on his authority. That’s a quite modern, egalitarian, and refreshing point of view. — location: [1396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1396) ^ref-36173

---
These things about the Buddha are quite impressive, but I think his most important contribution is that he was the first person in history to clearly articulate a new facet of meditation. Because there is this feedback link between calming and concentrating, people had had a tendency to look upon calm/concentration as the be-all and end-all. They believed that the goal of the path was to get greater and greater concentration and go deeper and deeper into pleasant, absorbed states. — location: [1398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1398) ^ref-3351

---
But according to the traditional accounts, the Buddha discovered an entirely new attentional skill. He found that you could use it to get deep insights into yourself, even the profoundest insights of enlightenment. He discovered how to develop a sort of internal microscope to carefully observe the nature of your own sensory experience. This discovery brought a whole new dimension to meditation: the dimension of clarifying and untangling. Clarifying and untangling fosters insight into fundamental issues—the nature of self, the nature of suffering, the nature of oneness, perhaps even the nature of nature. — location: [1402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1402) ^ref-46838

---
He discovered how to microscopically investigate in real time the nature of sensory experience, how to break the complex experience of self into manageable sensory elements. This led to an understanding that would permanently uproot the source of suffering, not merely suspend it due to an altered state. After that, people referred to him as a Buddha, which means an awakened person. — location: [1434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1434) ^ref-18768

At any given instant, you may have emotional-type sensation in your body or you may not. By emotional-type body sensations, I mean things like teary-sadness in the eyes, tense-anger in the jaw, queasy-fear in the belly, pleasant-smile on the face, enthusiastic-interest over the whole body, and so forth. These kinds of body sensations are important components of any emotional experience. — location: [1443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1443) ^ref-13661

---
Mental images are a second component. You mentally see the scene, the people, the situation. You get a mental picture of what your body looks like, and you get mental pictures of the scene around you. You relive the past or fantasize about the future. All involve mental images. So “image activity” is also an important component in an experience of an emotion. — location: [1446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1446) ^ref-9600

The three basic components of any emotional experience, then, are mental imagery, mental talk, and emotional-type body sensations.

---
At any given instant, you either have mental images or you don’t (two possibilities). At that same instant, for each of those two possibilities, you have two further possibilities: you either have mental talk or you don’t. Do the math. We now have four (2 × 2 = 4) logical possibilities for any given instant. But at the same instant for each of those four possibilities, you either have body emotion or you don’t, which multiplies the possibilities again by two, yielding a grand total of eight (4 × 2 = 8) basic states: three possible single occurrences (mental image, mental talk, body emotion), three possible paired occurrences (any two at the same time), and two possible extreme situations (all three inner… — location: [1459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1459) ^ref-18802

If you monitor your inner experience (memory, plan, fantasy, worry, will, desire, problem solving, judgment, conviction, confusion, and so on) in terms of the eight basic states, you’ll notice something remarkable. When all three elements activate strongly, the perception “I am a separate thing” is very intense. But if only one or two activate mildly, the perception “I am a separate thing” becomes somewhat reduced. And most amazingly of all, every once in a while, the inner system spontaneously goes offline, causing your sense of a separate self to vanish. Something that fluctuates with time is a wave not a thing. And something that vanishes and… — location: [1481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1481) ^ref-11426

Breaking a complex experience down into its components makes it easier to understand, thus giving us insight. It also divides up a difficult experience into smaller, less individually challenging pieces. And this makes it easier to cope with. — location: [1512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1512) ^ref-4327

If you do the samatha practice and experience wonderful, tranquil states, these represent a porous and attenuated self that can be relatively easily penetrated with vipassana. If you can’t get to the restful states, that’s okay. You do dry vipassana, and as a result, the blockages get deconstructed into their elements, and they lose their gripping force. After that, you automatically find yourself dropping into pleasant, absorbed samatha states simply because you’ve worked through the forces that would prevent those states from happening. It’s a win-win situation. Samatha helps vipassana, and vipassana helps samatha. — location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1573) ^ref-51394

If you really understand the complementary relationship between samatha practice and vipassana practice, you realize that, no matter what your situation, there is always something productive you can do. — location: [1577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1577) ^ref-37463

Personally, I like to slice up the pie of sensory experience slightly differently. I separate body experience into physical-type body sensations and emotional-type body sensations. For simplicity, I include the chemical senses, smell and taste, into the category of physical-type body sensations. I separate mental experience into a visual component (mental images) and an auditory component (mental talk). This creates a nice symmetrical system: the core subjective self—thoughts, emotions, will, conviction, confusion, judgment, reaction, memory, problem solving, fantasy—all arise through the “inner activity” of mental images, mental talk, and emotional body sensations. The perception that there’s a physical world around us arises through “outer activity”—physical sights, physical sounds, and physical body sensations. Let’s look briefly at the nuts and bolts of this formulation. — location: [1649](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1649) ^ref-22471
