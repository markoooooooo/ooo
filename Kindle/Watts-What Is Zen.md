## Highlights
The practice of Zen is to experience the overall pattern directly, and to know one’s self as the essence of the pattern. — location: [139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NT3BJ8&location=139) ^ref-6030

If somebody asks you a question about matters sacred, always answer in terms of matters profane. If they ask you about ultimate reality, answer in terms of everyday life. If they ask you about everyday life, answer in terms of ultimate reality. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NT3BJ8&location=222) ^ref-51247

That is answering the metaphysical in terms of the everyday, and that is, more or less, the principle Zen works on. The mundane and the sacred are one and the same. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NT3BJ8&location=228) ^ref-45329

When they look at you with a funny look, they see who you really are, and are looking through your eyes to the divine center. And here one sees Buddha, Brahma, or whatever you want to call it, pretending not to be at home! It’s no wonder the guru has a funny look — they are beholding the incongruity between the divine being that looks out through you in your eyes, and the expression of puzzlement on your face! — location: [310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NT3BJ8&location=310) ^ref-23593

We have been taught by social convention, though, to restrict the concept of “myself” to “what I do voluntarily and consciously.” This is a very narrow view of the self. Certainly if you say, “I, by my ego and my intelligence, created all this,” you would be conceited, and you know you are a liar. But you is much deeper than that; you includes far more than your conscious mind. It is the total you that not only is responsible for the infinitely complex structure of your physical organism, but also for the environment in which you find yourself. You runs that deep. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002NT3BJ8&location=349) ^ref-44329
