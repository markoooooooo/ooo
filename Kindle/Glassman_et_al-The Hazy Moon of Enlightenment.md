## Highlights
Psychological materialism is shielding oneself from the fear of death and decay through intellectual and aesthetic pursuits, trying to make oneself into a perfect work of art. — location: [87](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=87) ^ref-64890

The most profound right motive, according to the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, is to awaken oneself to buddha nature. Whenever doubt arises, one should cut through it; doing this, one finds behind it a state of brilliant wakefulness. The doubt which must be cut through is not so much intellectual uncertainty, but general slothfulness. — location: [88](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=88) ^ref-54766

I finally decided that Reality must be unlike any preconceived idea I might have of it and reached a point of just waiting and letting be. For long periods I simply sat, saying inwardly “No, not this” as if waiting, for what I knew not. — location: [1972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=1972) ^ref-25692

To the extent that I had become academically successful, I had become in a deeper sense unwise, unintelligent, unfree, and unloving. — location: [2105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2105) ^ref-27688

When, for one reason or another, I attended one of our community’s churches, all I seemed to find was an organized effort to protect and distract people from the awesome struggle and dangers of transformation. — location: [2116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2116) ^ref-37832

“Shikantaza is like sitting in the center of a clearing in the forest, knowing that ultimate danger is about to strike, but not knowing what form it will take or from what direction it will come.” — location: [2143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2143) ^ref-43532

Every moment of attention, however seemingly trivial, opens to infinity as the perceptual field becomes ever more articulated and clear, without limit. — location: [2174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2174) ^ref-21946

So ever present that we seldom recognize it, this primary mode of perception is available to each of us at every waking moment. We can experience it by doing nothing more special than not doing what we spend the better part of our lives doing. We have only to sit quietly, breathing naturally, becoming aware of small eye jumps and sub-vocal dialogue by letting them quiet down. Neither tracking nor following anything, we then open the field of perception to whatever occurs, neither clinging to what has just passed nor anticipating the next event. A bird may fly across the field, a child call, a car starts — that’s all, no more. All the principles of Zen practice are embodied in this radically simple attention. — location: [2175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2175) ^ref-64604

So long as we remain an “I” who meditates, or an “I” who aspires to enlightenment, we remain trapped in the age-old contradiction. — location: [2185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01FR8RGJM&location=2185) ^ref-29334
