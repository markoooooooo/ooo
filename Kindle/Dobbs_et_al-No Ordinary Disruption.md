TechCity in London, 1871 in Chicago, 1776 in Washington, DC, and 22@ in Barcelona are all examples of such urban collaborative spaces. In San Francisco, SFMade, a nonprofit set up in 2010, seeks to promote local manufacturing in the city. In New York, Made in NYC has a similar aim, looking to support nearly seven thousand small local manufacturers.

Over the past two decades, the amplifying forces of industrialization, technology, and the urbanization of emerging economies have driven incomes higher for billions of people, lifting 700 million out of poverty and adding 1.2 billion new members to the consuming class.10 From a societal perspective, this level of poverty eradication prevents more deaths from poverty-related diseases and hunger than the lives saved per year through eradication of smallpox, often hailed as the greatest health-care achievement of the twentieth century. — location: [1712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1712) ^ref-28658

Many global companies, for example, make the mistake of conducting Brazilian consumer research in São Paulo, not realizing that the cosmopolitan city has more in common culturally with New York, 4,771 miles away, than with Curitiba, the capital of Parana state (population 1.7 million), which is just 210 miles away. — location: [1835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1835) ^ref-29981

For new entrants to Brazil, the populous but historically poor northeast of the country, where boomtowns like Salvador are expected to grow 2.4-fold by 2015, may offer better prospects, even if setting up operations is more difficult.35 This is not exactly a new idea. Walmart grew into America’s largest retailer from the inside of the country out, finding underserved towns and avoiding highly competitive metropolitan markets. — location: [1853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1853) ^ref-42578

VF Corporation, one of the ten largest fashion companies in the world, redesigned the way it manages its supply chains in response to an increasingly expanding footprint. Relying on an integrated IT system, VF designed “The Third Way,” in which different brands in its portfolio aggregate their sourcing needs in order to create economies of scale. The company also works closely with manufacturers so that it can produce many different branded products in a single factory. From the mid-to-late 2000s, doing so allowed VF to reduce the production cost of jeans and other apparel by between 5 and 10 percent. — location: [1921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1921) ^ref-56117

“In some ways, capital is easier to reallocate than people—you can sit in Brussels, look at the annual capital flows of the different businesses, and act accordingly,” said Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, chief executive officer of Solvay, the Belgian chemicals company. “With people, there is always a tendency to manage in geographic or business ‘silos.’ That’s why we have recently established a new principle: that the top 300 people in the group are corporate assets.”56 In other words, the company’s leading employees will be rotated across global operations based on local needs and growth rather than remaining at the company’s headquarters. — location: [1994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1994) ^ref-60066

Our observation, however, is that companies experience success when they are able to break away from the “investing in a market” mentality and give local leaders sufficient freedom to chart their own path. — location: [2004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2004) ^ref-52063

The rise of a new class of consumers around the world is imposing a tough new set of requirements on established companies. Advantages in a home market can’t be easily replicated or taken for granted in far-flung markets. But the opportunities are too large to ignore.

people are going online and plugging in, and more people are joining the ranks of the world’s consumers. As a result, more organizations may find, as Clarks Village did, that the world is beating a new, entirely unpredicted path to their doorstep—at the same time that consumers in markets previously considered closed off are acquiring a taste for the types of products they make. Smart companies that systematically rethink the way they approach, manage, and serve all the world’s promising markets can figure out how to meet customers where they are—and where they will be. — location: [2020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2020) ^ref-24434

The prices of a basket of key commodities—including energy, metals, food, and water—had fallen by almost half in real terms during the twentieth century. This remarkable development occurred despite the fact that the world’s population quadrupled and global GDP per capita increased nearly fivefold.11 The falling prices were all the more remarkable considering that rising standards of living and energy intensity helped push demand for commodities up by between 600 and 2,000 percent.12 Significant advances in productivity—the application of steam power to mining, the widespread mechanization of agriculture, the construction of massive dams—helped humanity exert more effective control over the production, distribution, trade, and storage of commodities. Falling commodity prices served as a major tailwind, helping world economic output expand more than twenty times in the twentieth century. And with the exception of the oil crises of the 1970s, productivity in the use of resources was not a priority. But this important trend has decisively ended. Thanks in large measure to sharply rising demand and to challenges to supply in key commodity sectors like oil and water, resource prices have doubled on average between 2000 and 2013.13 The average price of a range of energy sources shot up by 260 percent in this period. Metals prices surged by 176 percent, copper by 344 percent, and steel by 167 percent. Food prices, which fell by an average of 0.7 percent a year during the twentieth century, rose by almost 120 percent between 2000 and 2013. — location: [2072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2072) ^ref-62397

Estimates are that India will rise from the tenth-largest economy in the world in 2013 to the third largest by 2030.4 India’s young and rapidly urbanizing population could become the country’s “demographic dividend,” fueling growth and prosperity over the decades to come. By 2030, India could have an urban population of approximately six hundred million, nearly twice that of the entire United States as of this writing. India will be home to two of the world’s five most populous cities, along with sixty-eight other cities of more than one million inhabitants each. — location: [2369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2369) ^ref-24902

As the emerging world continues to industrialize and urbanize, its need for investment is surging. From Kumasi to Mumbai, from Porto Alegre to Kuala Lumpur, capital-intensive building projects are being planned. As countries invest in infrastructure, the additional demand will be amplified by companies seeking to invest in new capacity, equipment, and upgrades in order to keep up with disruptive technologies. These demands on capital will coincide with an aging global population and long-term government deficits—which will put pressure on the world’s pool of savings just as demand picks up. Based on the traditional view of macroeconomic fundamentals, the combination of rising demand and pressure on supply spells one outcome: a world with tighter, more expensive capital.

However, the unconventional monetary policy of recent years has taken us into uncharted territory and may have laid the foundations for a different, less easily comprehended world. It is one in which central banks and governments are always ready to step in and inject sufficient liquidity into the economy to keep it growing and keep interest rates low. Governments, of course, have been among the chief beneficiaries of these low rates. It is a world of fragile equilibriums, where periods of aggressive expansion of money supply may be followed by asset bubbles, inflationary challenges, and booms and busts of currencies. An increasing number of countries are exploring this new territory. In fact, we may be on the brink of transition into a world where expansive monetary policy and debt monetization—once considered taboo—become normal components of the central banks’ repertoire. — location: [2426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2426) ^ref-19971

Brazil, Indonesia, India, and China need a lot of bricks and mortar. The world’s growing cities will need to double their stock of physical capital investment from nearly $10 trillion in 2013 to more than $20 trillion by 2025.18 All the people moving to cities will need apartments to live in, roads to drive on, and schools to attend. — location: [2447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2447) ^ref-49189

Overall, we calculate that through 2030, the world needs to spend an estimated $57 trillion to $67 trillion on roads, buildings, rails, telecoms, ports, and water just to enable expected economic growth.25 That’s more than the entire worldwide stock of infrastructure on the ground today—and nearly 60 percent more than the world invested between 1994 and 2012.26 These investments, combined with the need to replace depreciated or outdated capital, will drive global total investment to $25 trillion by 2030 from $13 trillion in 2008, the peak before the financial crisis. — location: [2465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2465) ^ref-24558

Should interest rates rise, overruns can prove fatal. Based on our experience across sectors, a combination of project reprioritization, shortening of project life cycles, and tight project execution can deliver as much as a 10 to 25 percent reduction in spending and a 20 to 50 percent reduction in delays.47 A real estate company in the Middle East, for example, reduced cycle time by 30 percent for a $500 million tower project by taking advantage of lean management techniques—such as performance dialogues and war rooms—and prefabricating forms for beams and construction joints. These efforts allowed it to avoid $50 million in penalties for time overruns, while reducing the overall cost. — location: [2558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2558) ^ref-21706

In the five-year period ending in 2012, Asian carmakers reported a ratio of capital expenditures to revenue that was 30 percent lower than that of their European counterparts.50 Many companies can also seek to optimize their working capital productivity by adapting collection terms or cutting inventory. Take Tesla as an example. By requiring customers to pay $2,500 to $5,000 to make a reservation for purchase, the electric car manufacturer not only obtains a clearer view of the demand pipeline but minimizes the working capital necessary to run its operations.51 In effect, Tesla has managed to get its customers to provide its working capital. In December 2013, Tesla held customer deposits in excess of $160 million.52 Amazon, as another example, keeps only the fastest-moving items in stock in all of its distribution centers, carefully using advanced technology to pick the right items and stock levels. Taking immediate payments from customers and paying its suppliers with a month delay, Amazon operates with negative working capital. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Amazon reported accounts receivable of $4.77 billion and accounts payable of $15.133 billion, giving it a “float” of more than $10 billion of extremely cheap capital.53 If the top 10 global retailers had Amazon’s cash conversion cycle, they would collectively save over $150 billion in working capital. — location: [2573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2573) ^ref-6253

Considering that more than 70 percent of global growth—and associated new investment opportunities—will come from emerging markets, gaining exposure to these growth markets and understanding their capital restrictions and financial regulation is becoming essential for investors.

Our research suggests that emerging-market companies are growing more than twice as quickly as their counterparts in developed economies.18 Over the coming decade, the GDP of emerging markets may increase by a factor of 2.5, which will reset the global competition landscape. Seven out of ten of the new “billion-level” companies—firms with annual sales of more than $1 billion—are likely to be based in emerging regions. The number of large companies based in these countries could increase from 2,200 today to around 7,000. If that holds true, China alone will house more large companies than either the United States or Western Europe by 2025.19 — location: [3063](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=3063) ^ref-16882
