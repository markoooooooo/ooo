## Highlights
Genius is not so much a light as it is a constant awareness of the surrounding gloom, and its typical cowardice is to bathe in its own glow and avoid, as much as possible, looking out beyond its boundary. No matter how much genuine strength it may contain, there is also, inevitably, a considerable part that is only the pretense of that strength. — location: [181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08BSZ2S11&location=181) ^ref-55467
