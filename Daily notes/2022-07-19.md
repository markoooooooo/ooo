*   **[Prospero](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/characters/charlines.php?CharID=Prospero&WorkID=tempest).**Â You do look, my son, in a moved sort,  
    As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.  
    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,  
    As I foretold you, were all spirits and1880  
    Are melted into air, into thin air:  
    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  
    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,  
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,  
    Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve1885  
    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,  
    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff  
    As dreams are made on, and our little life  
    Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;  
    Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:1890  
    Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:  
    If you be pleased, retire into my cell  
    And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,  
    To still my beating mind.
