## Highlights
- eudaimonism. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0040JHNQG&location=487))
- someone who practices Stoic principles “must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attended by constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desires no joys greater than his inner joys.” ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0040JHNQG&location=646))
- According to Epictetus, the primary concern of philosophy should be the art of living: Just as wood is the medium of the carpenter and bronze is the medium of the sculptor, your life is the medium on which you practice the art of living.24 ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0040JHNQG&location=710))
- “BEGIN EACH DAY by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness—all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.” ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0040JHNQG&location=757))
- Hedonic adaptation has the power to extinguish our enjoyment of the world. Because of adaptation, we take our life and what we have for granted rather than delighting in them. Negative visualization, though, is a powerful antidote to hedonic adaptation. By consciously thinking about the loss of what we have, we can regain our appreciation of it, and with this regained appreciation we can revitalize our capacity for joy.
