## Highlights
- The ninth-century Indian philosopher Śāntideva argues in How to Lead an Awakened Life (Bodhicāryāvatāra) that our conviction that we are selves arises from a primal fear of death, and that we construct the idea of a self as a bulwark against that fear.10 Śāntideva also argues that the idea that we are selves arises primarily in emotionally charged situations, as when we perceive that we have been harmed, or when pride is aroused. It is then that we think not of our minds or bodies, but of we who possess those minds and bodies. David Hume adopts a similar view. He argues that the thought that we are selves is a product of the passions—that we posit the self as the object of pride and humility, and then reify it in thought.11 ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M7XCWQX&location=324))

- Nāgasena replies coyly that he is really nobody; that he is called Nāgasena, but that this is just a name, a designation, and there is nothing to which it really refers. The name Nāgasena refers not to his body, his mind, his experiences, nor to anything apart from these. If you seek the referent of the name, he argues, you find nothing. This is a pretty standard articulation of the Buddhist view that there is no self, no ātman. But it is just the opening move in the debate.

- My body and my psychological states are constantly changing, like the oil and lamps that support the flames. But, like those flames and those lamps, they constitute a causal sequence with a common function. And we have a convention of calling distinct members of such sequences by the same name. So, in one obvious sense, I am not identical to the person called by my name yesterday. We are alike, causally related, but numerically distinct. In another sense, though, we are the same person. We share a name, many properties, a causal history, and a social role; and that, while not involving a self, is enough.4 ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M7XCWQX&location=457))
- To put this another way, we do not stand over and against the world as isolated subjects; we do not act on the world as transcendent agents. Instead, we are embedded in the world as part of an interdependent reality. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M7XCWQX&location=466))

- If you take all of these away, though, there is nothing left: no bearer, no special entity that we recognize apart from our bodies, minds, and experiences. And when we introspect to find ourselves, all we find are our minds, bodies, and experiences. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M7XCWQX&location=496))
- Consider, to take another analogy, a dollar. There are lots of ways to have a dollar. You might have a dollar bill, a dollar coin, ten dimes, or an electronic record. Your dollar, however, is neither identical to nor different from any of these ways that it might be instantiated. It isn’t identical, because you could swap dimes for paper and still have the same dollar. It is not different, because whether you hand me the paper banknote or the stack of dimes, you have handed me your dollar. The dollar isn’t something apart from these. If I lose the paper or the dimes, I have lost the dollar. Nor is the dollar some distinct entity that possesses the dimes or the piece of paper. No account that takes the dollar to exist either as identical to or as different from the medium in which it is instantiated makes any sense at all.
