## Highlights
- the men of that planet conceive of the universe as a series of mental processes, whose unfolding is to be understood only as a time sequence. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XUYQUZ2&location=229))
- Each state of mind is irreducible. The mere act of giving it a name, that is of classifying it, implies a falsification of it. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XUYQUZ2&location=236))
- One of the schools in Tlön has reached the point of denying time. It reasons that the present is undefined, that the future has no other reality than as present hope, that the past is no more than present memory.
