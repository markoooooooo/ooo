## Highlights
- The essential point about meditation is this: to get anywhere in meditation you need to be able to steady the mind and be present in the present. That's all there is to it and it is largely a question of just doing it. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=677))
- continuous concentration versus moment-to-moment concentration. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=682))
- Let's begin by taking it as a wholesome given that there is some understanding that is completely beyond any ordinary understanding, even beyond the skillful altered states of consciousness that can be attained if we train well in concentration. The next premise is that there are specific practices that can and will lead to that understanding if we simply do them. The third and perhaps most vital premise is that we can do these specific practices and be successful. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=760))
- Insight practice can seem more daunting, complex, or bizarre than other forms of practice. However, it is oddly simple. There are six sense doors. Sensations arise and vanish. Notice this for every sensation. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=783))
- The gold standard for training in morality is how consciously harmless, kind, skillful, and compassionate our intentions, words, and actions are and how well we lead a useful and moral life. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=793))
- The gold standard for training in concentration is how quickly we can enter into specific, skillful, altered states of consciousness on our own meditative power, how long we can stay in them, and how refined, complete, and stable we can make those states. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=794))
- The gold standard for training in wisdom with insight practices is that we can quickly and consistently perceive the true nature of the countless quick sensations that make up our whole reality, regardless of what those sensations are, allowing us to cut to a level of understanding that goes utterly beyond specific conditions but includes them all. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=796))
- Having gained at least enough morality to be temporarily free of agitating negative mind states and enough concentration to steady the mind, turn your attention to the bare truth of the sensations of this moment. This is called insight meditation, which is designed to produce a form of knowledge or wisdom that can transform and free us from our core perceptual misinterpretations of sensate reality. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=801))
- Many people try to make insight practices into an exercise that will produce both insights into the ordinary world and ultimate insights. There are numerous traditions that specifically advocate for this sort of practice that attempts to work on both fronts simultaneously. However, I have concluded that we should not count on ultimate teachings to illuminate or resolve our relative issues or vice versa. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=811))
- Therefore, it is extremely important not only to practice all three trainings, but also not to conflate the relative and ultimate wisdom teachings. Failure to do so causes endless problems and makes progress more difficult. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=813))
- They falsely imagine that by training in insight they have mastered or gone beyond the training in or need for morality. We awaken to the actual truth of our life in all its conventional aspects, so make sure that yours is a life you want to wake up to. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=820))
- The three characteristics of impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self are so central to the Buddha's teachings that it is almost inconceivable how little attention the majority of “insight” meditators give them. I cannot possibly overstate the usefulness of trying again and again to really discern these three qualities of all experience. They are the stuff from which ultimate insight at all stages comes, pure and simple. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=827))
- “Understand the true nature of things,” what I mean is, “Directly perceive the three characteristics.” To perceive them thoroughly and directly is to be awakened. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=831))
- Somehow this exceedingly important message doesn't typically seem to get through to insight meditators, so they spend much time doing anything but looking precisely, moment to moment, into the three characteristics. They may be thinking about something, lost in the stories and tape loops of the mind, trying to work out their stuff, philosophizing, trying to quiet the mind, or who knows what, and this can go on retreat after… ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=832))
- The big message here is: drop the stories. Find a physical object like the breath, the body, pain, or pleasure, some feeling of resistance you may be experiencing, etc., and train yourself to perceive the three characteristics precisely and consistently. Drop to the level of bare… ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=837))

- Regarding impermanence, it is wise to reflect on our own mortality, a common reflection in many Buddhist traditions, for it is useful and true. This is a reflection on ordinary reality and thus an aspect of training in morality that is commonly used to develop motivation to train in insight. I gained some dharmic benefits and relative insights from the one hundred and sixty hours we spend in medical school dissecting a corpse down to… ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=863))
- I mean that sensations arise out of nothing, do their thing, and vanish utterly. Gone. Entirely gone. Then the next sensation arises, does… ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=867))
- Some people can get all into complex wave or particle models here, but do yourself a favor and don't. Just examine your actual experience, especially something nice and physical like the motion and sensations of the breath in the abdomen, the sensations of the tips of the fingers, the lips, the bridge of the nose, beneath the nose and above the lip, or the subtle tingling on the scalp and so on. Instant by instant, try to know when the actual physical sensations are there and when they are not. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=872))
- It turns out they are not there a good bit of the time, and even when they are, they are changing constantly. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=876))
- Being clear about exactly when the physical sensations are present will begin to clarify their slippery counterparts—flickering mental impressions—that help co-create the illusion of continuity, stability, or solidity. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=879))

- This habit of creating a mental impression following any of the physical sensations is the standard way the mind operates on phenomena that are no longer actually there, even mental sensations such as seemingly auditory thoughts, that is, mental talk (our inner “voice”), intentions, and mental images. It is like an echo, a resonance. The mind forms a general impression of the object, and that is what we can think about, remember, and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical pulse. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=884))

- “Some people say there is mind. I say there is no mind, but never mind! Heh, heh, heh!” ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=891))
- there are only utterly transient mental sensations. Truly, there is no stable, unitary, discrete entity called “mind” that can be located! ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=893))
- Each one of these sensations (the physical sensation and the mental impression) arises and vanishes completely before another begins, so it is possible to sort out which is which with relatively stable attention dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=895))
- This means that the instant you have experienced something, you can know that it isn't there anymore, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=897))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are typically many other momentary sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=899))
- Given that you now know that sensations are vibrating, pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice, every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now know exactly what you are looking for. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=901))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You have a clear standard. If you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and develop more clarity about exactly when and where there are physical sensations. Spend time with this, as long as it takes. The whole goal is to experience momentariness directly, that is, things flickering, and what those things are doesn't matter one bit! ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=902))
- Interpretation is particularly useless in insight meditation, so you don't have to spend time doing it when you are on the cushion. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=905))
- Thoughts, even supposedly good ones, are just too slippery and seductive most of the time, even for advanced meditators, though if you can avoid getting lost in their content they are as valid a stream of sensate objects for insight practices as any other. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=907))
- When doing insight practices, try to limit yourself to no more than a few minutes of skillful reflection per hour of meditation. This should be more than enough. There are simply no substitutes for this sort of momentum in practice. If you can get that reflection down to no minutes at all, so much the better. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=908))

- How fast are things vibrating? How many sensations arise and vanish each second? ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=911))
- Try it! Count “one, one thousand” and tap with each syllable. So, you now know you can experience at least eight things in a second! You experienced the four syllables and the four taps that went along with them. You probably experienced all sorts of other things also, like sights, sounds, other physical sensations, and a lot more during that one second. Yay! That is insight practice. You are already up to at least eight sensations per second. Yay, you! ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=918))
- Investigate reality that fast and you will learn some seriously cool things. Add in noticing the intentions to tap each of those taps and the mental impressions of all of the sensations you just experienced, and suddenly you are rockin’ it like a boss in the world of insight meditation. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=923))
- There are faster and slower vibrations that may show up, some very fast (maybe up to forty times per second or so) and some very slow (that are actually made up of faster vibrations), but let's just say that one to ten times per second can sometimes be a useful guideline in the beginning. Once you get the hang of it, the faster and slower vibrations are no big deal. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=925))
- However, in the beginning you should go for faster vibrations over slower ones and then later try for broader and more inclusive ones over those that are narrower. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=931))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Don't worry if things look or feel solid sometimes. Just be with the solidity clearly and precisely, but not too tightly, and that pattern of sensations that implies solidity can start to reveal its impermanence. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=932))
- Be aware of each exact moment in which you experience solidity and its beginning and ending. Remember that each experience of solidity is a discrete, impermanent sensation. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=934))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Still, the general concept that you are looking for something changing moderately fast but still quite manageable is key. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=936))

- It is also worth noting here that the frequency or rate of vibrations may change often, either getting faster or slower, and that it is worth trying to perceive clearly the beginning and ending of each vibration or pulse of reality. These are actually at least two different sensations! ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=943))
- It is also useful to check out exactly what happens at the bottom, middle, and top of the breath if you are using the breath as an object, and to examine if the frequency remains stable or changes in each phase of the breath. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=945))
- Finding the exact end of the out-breath is a commonly used exercise of great profundity once mastered. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947))
- Never assume that what you have understood is a final, fixed answer. Be alert. Explore carefully and precisely with openness and acceptance. This is the door to understanding. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947))
- One last thing about vibrations: exploring vibrations can be a lot like any other sport. We can think of it the same way as we would of surfing or playing tennis, and this playful game-like attitude can help a lot. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=949))
- You don't know quite what the next return or wave is going to be like, so pay attention, keep the mind on the pulse of the sensations of your world just as you would on the wave or ball, and keep playing! ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=951))
- you can perceive one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity shatters. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=958))
- In short, when doing insight practices, constantly work to perceive sensations arise and pass as quickly and accurately as you possibly can. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=959))
- With the spirit of a race car driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and still stay on the track, stay on the cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations quickly and accurately. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=960))
- In one of these exercises, I sit quietly in a quiet place, close my eyes, put my right hand on my right knee, my left hand on my left knee, and concentrate just on my two index fingers. Basic dharma theory tells me that it is not possible to perceive both fingers simultaneously; so, with this knowledge, I try to see in each instant which one of the two fingers’ physical sensations are being perceived at any given moment. Once the mind has sped up a bit and become more stable, I try to perceive the arising and passing of each of these sensations. I may do this for half an hour or an hour, just staying with the sensations in my two fingers and perceiving when each sensation is and is not there. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=965))
- the illusion of a separate perceiver is partially supported by one impermanent sensation incorrectly seeming to perceive another impermanent sensation which it follows, such as the sensations in the back of the head incorrectly seeming to perceive the sensations of the front of the head, ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=976))

- the second aspect of dukkha is the key for insight practices, and that is the inherent painful tension that comes because we take the sensate data coming in and misinterpret those sensations in a way that causes us to habitually create the illusion of a permanent, separate, independently functioning (acausal), localized self. This mode of perceiving experience is more painful than the other way that sensate reality can be perceived, in which sensate data imply the exact reverse: that there is naturally occurring, causal, self-perceiving, immediate transience. Insight practices can show us this other, less painful way of perceiving reality, and eventually hardwire it into our systems so that we don't go back to the more painful way which involves the dukkha created by this misperception. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1049))

- Remember that awakening is not a thing or a mind state or a thought, it is an understanding of perspective without some separate entity that perceives. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1061))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- Once you have some mental stability, you can even examine the bare experience of the sensations that make up the stories that spin in your mind and see how unsatisfactory and unsettling it is to try to pretend they are a self or the property of some imagined self. If we continue to habituate ourselves to this understanding moment to moment we may get it into our thick heads and finally awaken.

- At a rate of one to ten times per second, try to experience exactly how you know that you wish to do something other than simply face your current experience as it is. Moment to moment, try to discern every little uncomfortable shift, urge, impulse, and tension that prods your mind into fantasizing about the past or future or stopping the meditation entirely.

- However, I have found that this kind of investigation pays off in ways I could never have imagined. Later, I will explain a stage called “the Knowledges of Suffering”, aka “the Dark Night”.

- Even the most pleasant sensations have a tinge of misery to them, not only because they end, but also due to the strange way we hold our minds to create a sense of a stable self in a changing world, so look for it at the level of bare experience.

- Emptiness, for all its mysterious-sounding connotations, means that reality is empty of, devoid of, or lacking a permanent, separate, independent, acausal, autonomous self. It doesn't mean that reality is not there, but that reality is not there in the way it may appear to us to be.

- That the “watcher” (whatever seems to be observing things, aka the “perceiving subject”) is a thing separable and independent from what is perceived is mistaken. However, all of this is not merely an illusion, though how the “watcher” is perceived and how sensate experience is interpreted initially is clearly delusional, as good practice eventually may reveal.

- With systematic debunking through insight practices of the illusion of some sense of a permanent, separate, independently existing self, we learn to perceive things as they are naturally. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1170))

- When we get good at perceiving them all as they are, including everything that typically seems to be on “this side”, the whole thing can flip around, and suddenly all the sensations that seemed to be a “self” or property of that “self” are perceived as just sensations—natural, causal, transient—and not a self or permanent thing at all. In fact, they never were, and this can be clearly perceived by skilled practitioners. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1175))

- It is in some ways very much like the classic drawing by William Ely Hill that can be viewed two ways, either as a young woman or as an old woman. Whichever you see first tends to stick in your mind and then it can be tricky to see the other one until someone points out the features that make up the other face, and then suddenly you see the same set of lines in a totally different way. Insight practices create effects very much like that: same sensations, totally different implications. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1179))

- It's not that the constellation labeled “me”, or “you”, a grouping of physical and mental components, does not exist and function in some ordinary sense. It's that none of those components exist independently or acausally, which is how ignorance conceives of them. Ultimate unfindability of the components of reality in no way precludes their conventional existence! ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1187))
- Another very important, related thing: the creation of the sense of an ultimate, permanent, continuous, stable self is a process of identification, not a stable entity in and of itself. It is like a bad habit, in this case a habitual misperception, but it doesn't exist as something that can be found beyond a shifting pattern of mere sensations and causality.

- By understanding our bare experience more clearly the process of identification can stop, and by identification, I mean misperceiving various aspects of experience such as body and thoughts as being equivalent to a “self”.

- Any thoughts with “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine” in them should be understood to be just thoughts that come and go. They are simply qualities of manifestation, like flavors of ice cream. It is not that chocolate is good and vanilla is bad; all flavors of experience are just flavors, and sometimes the flavor of the moment is “I”, “me”, “mine”, and the like, and even those flavors don't constitute a real “I”, “me”, or “mine”. So, if those qualities arise, just notice them come and go like everything else. They never were an “I”, “me”, or “mine” and never could be.
