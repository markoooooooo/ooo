## Highlights
- The essential point about meditation is this: to get anywhere in meditation you need to be able to steady the mind and be present in the present. That's all there is to it and it is largely a question of just doing it. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=677))
- continuous concentration versus moment-to-moment concentration. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=682))
- Let's begin by taking it as a wholesome given that there is some understanding that is completely beyond any ordinary understanding, even beyond the skillful altered states of consciousness that can be attained if we train well in concentration. The next premise is that there are specific practices that can and will lead to that understanding if we simply do them. The third and perhaps most vital premise is that we can do these specific practices and be successful. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=760))
- Insight practice can seem more daunting, complex, or bizarre than other forms of practice. However, it is oddly simple. There are six sense doors. Sensations arise and vanish. Notice this for every sensation. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=783))
- The gold standard for training in morality is how consciously harmless, kind, skillful, and compassionate our intentions, words, and actions are and how well we lead a useful and moral life. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=793))
- The gold standard for training in concentration is how quickly we can enter into specific, skillful, altered states of consciousness on our own meditative power, how long we can stay in them, and how refined, complete, and stable we can make those states. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=794))
- The gold standard for training in wisdom with insight practices is that we can quickly and consistently perceive the true nature of the countless quick sensations that make up our whole reality, regardless of what those sensations are, allowing us to cut to a level of understanding that goes utterly beyond specific conditions but includes them all. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=796))
- Having gained at least enough morality to be temporarily free of agitating negative mind states and enough concentration to steady the mind, turn your attention to the bare truth of the sensations of this moment. This is called insight meditation, which is designed to produce a form of knowledge or wisdom that can transform and free us from our core perceptual misinterpretations of sensate reality. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=801))
- Many people try to make insight practices into an exercise that will produce both insights into the ordinary world and ultimate insights. There are numerous traditions that specifically advocate for this sort of practice that attempts to work on both fronts simultaneously. However, I have concluded that we should not count on ultimate teachings to illuminate or resolve our relative issues or vice versa. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=811))
- Therefore, it is extremely important not only to practice all three trainings, but also not to conflate the relative and ultimate wisdom teachings. Failure to do so causes endless problems and makes progress more difficult. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=813))
- They falsely imagine that by training in insight they have mastered or gone beyond the training in or need for morality. We awaken to the actual truth of our life in all its conventional aspects, so make sure that yours is a life you want to wake up to. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=820))
- The three characteristics of impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self are so central to the Buddha's teachings that it is almost inconceivable how little attention the majority of “insight” meditators give them. I cannot possibly overstate the usefulness of trying again and again to really discern these three qualities of all experience. They are the stuff from which ultimate insight at all stages comes, pure and simple. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=827))
- “Understand the true nature of things,” what I mean is, “Directly perceive the three characteristics.” To perceive them thoroughly and directly is to be awakened. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=831))
- Somehow this exceedingly important message doesn't typically seem to get through to insight meditators, so they spend much time doing anything but looking precisely, moment to moment, into the three characteristics. They may be thinking about something, lost in the stories and tape loops of the mind, trying to work out their stuff, philosophizing, trying to quiet the mind, or who knows what, and this can go on retreat after… ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=832))
- The big message here is: drop the stories. Find a physical object like the breath, the body, pain, or pleasure, some feeling of resistance you may be experiencing, etc., and train yourself to perceive the three characteristics precisely and consistently. Drop to the level of bare… ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=837))

- From the conventional perspective, things are usually believed to exist even when you no longer experience them directly, and are thus inferred to exist with only circumstantial evidence to be relatively stable entities. Predictability is confused with continuity of existence.… ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=848))

- In short, most of what you assume as making up your universe doesn't exist most of the time, from a purely sensate point of view. This is exactly, precisely, and specifically the… ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=856))

- Regarding impermanence, it is wise to reflect on our own mortality, a common reflection in many Buddhist traditions, for it is useful and true. This is a reflection on ordinary reality and thus an aspect of training in morality that is commonly used to develop motivation to train in insight. I gained some dharmic benefits and relative insights from the one hundred and sixty hours we spend in medical school dissecting a corpse down to… ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=863))
- I mean that sensations arise out of nothing, do their thing, and vanish utterly. Gone. Entirely gone. Then the next sensation arises, does… ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=867))
- Some people can get all into complex wave or particle models here, but do yourself a favor and don't. Just examine your actual experience, especially something nice and physical like the motion and sensations of the breath in the abdomen, the sensations of the tips of the fingers, the lips, the bridge of the nose, beneath the nose and above the lip, or the subtle tingling on the scalp and so on. Instant by instant, try to know when the actual physical sensations are there and when they are not. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=872))
- It turns out they are not there a good bit of the time, and even when they are, they are changing constantly. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=876))
- Being clear about exactly when the physical sensations are present will begin to clarify their slippery counterparts—flickering mental impressions—that help co-create the illusion of continuity, stability, or solidity. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=879))

- This habit of creating a mental impression following any of the physical sensations is the standard way the mind operates on phenomena that are no longer actually there, even mental sensations such as seemingly auditory thoughts, that is, mental talk (our inner “voice”), intentions, and mental images. It is like an echo, a resonance. The mind forms a general impression of the object, and that is what we can think about, remember, and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical pulse. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=884))

- “Some people say there is mind. I say there is no mind, but never mind! Heh, heh, heh!” ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=891))
- there are only utterly transient mental sensations. Truly, there is no stable, unitary, discrete entity called “mind” that can be located! ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=893))
- Each one of these sensations (the physical sensation and the mental impression) arises and vanishes completely before another begins, so it is possible to sort out which is which with relatively stable attention dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=895))
- This means that the instant you have experienced something, you can know that it isn't there anymore, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=897))

- There are typically many other momentary sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=899))
- Given that you now know that sensations are vibrating, pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice, every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now know exactly what you are looking for. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=901))

- You have a clear standard. If you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and develop more clarity about exactly when and where there are physical sensations. Spend time with this, as long as it takes. The whole goal is to experience momentariness directly, that is, things flickering, and what those things are doesn't matter one bit! ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=902))
- Interpretation is particularly useless in insight meditation, so you don't have to spend time doing it when you are on the cushion. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=905))
- Thoughts, even supposedly good ones, are just too slippery and seductive most of the time, even for advanced meditators, though if you can avoid getting lost in their content they are as valid a stream of sensate objects for insight practices as any other. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=907))
- When doing insight practices, try to limit yourself to no more than a few minutes of skillful reflection per hour of meditation. This should be more than enough. There are simply no substitutes for this sort of momentum in practice. If you can get that reflection down to no minutes at all, so much the better. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=908))

- How fast are things vibrating? How many sensations arise and vanish each second? ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=911))
- Try it! Count “one, one thousand” and tap with each syllable. So, you now know you can experience at least eight things in a second! You experienced the four syllables and the four taps that went along with them. You probably experienced all sorts of other things also, like sights, sounds, other physical sensations, and a lot more during that one second. Yay! That is insight practice. You are already up to at least eight sensations per second. Yay, you! ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=918))
- Investigate reality that fast and you will learn some seriously cool things. Add in noticing the intentions to tap each of those taps and the mental impressions of all of the sensations you just experienced, and suddenly you are rockin’ it like a boss in the world of insight meditation. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=923))
- There are faster and slower vibrations that may show up, some very fast (maybe up to forty times per second or so) and some very slow (that are actually made up of faster vibrations), but let's just say that one to ten times per second can sometimes be a useful guideline in the beginning. Once you get the hang of it, the faster and slower vibrations are no big deal. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=925))
- However, in the beginning you should go for faster vibrations over slower ones and then later try for broader and more inclusive ones over those that are narrower. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=931))

- Don't worry if things look or feel solid sometimes. Just be with the solidity clearly and precisely, but not too tightly, and that pattern of sensations that implies solidity can start to reveal its impermanence. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=932))
- Be aware of each exact moment in which you experience solidity and its beginning and ending. Remember that each experience of solidity is a discrete, impermanent sensation. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=934))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Still, the general concept that you are looking for something changing moderately fast but still quite manageable is key. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=936))
