## Highlights
- What she had seen before were mere shadows; only now did life’s true colors reveal themselves. ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=1633))
- “A bottomless abyss exists in every inch.” ([Location 4175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=4175))
- the mountain contained in a mustard seed described in Buddhist parables. ([Location 4318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=4318))
- Death is the only lighthouse that is always lit. No matter where you sail, ultimately, you must turn toward it. Everything fades in the world, but Death endures.” ([Location 6584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=6584))
- “From a scientific perspective, ‘destroy’ isn’t really accurate. Nothing has disappeared. All the matter that used to be there is still there, and so is all the angular momentum. It’s only the arrangement of matter that has changed, like a deck of cards being reshuffled. But life is like a straight flush: Once you shuffle, it’s gone.” ([Location 7039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=7039))
- Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is. ([Location 8700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=8700))
- like the rate at which continents drifted over the ocean: a centimeter for every ten thousand years. In such a world, if you got up from your lover and walked a few steps away, you would be separated from him by ten million years. ([Location 10239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=10239))
- The ultimate fate of all intelligent beings has always been to become as grand as their thoughts. ([Location 10602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016AWGJBK&location=10602))
