## Highlights
- 1969, the BBC ran Sir Kenneth Clark’s extraordinary thirteen-part documentary series Civilisation. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=130))
- Asking for proof was proof of racism. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=299))
- Therefore, only white people could be racist. Black people either could not be racist or, if they were racist, were racist only because they had “internalized whiteness.” ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=309))
- Naturally, many people disliked this sort of talk. They recognized the truth of Thomas Sowell’s 2012 observation that if racism in America is not dead, then it is certainly “on life support.” They knew the claims starting to be hurled out against their societies to be false, unfair, and much more. But they failed to take into account Sowell’s follow-on observation that racism was now being kept alive “by politicians, race hustlers, and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as ‘racists.’”7 ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=323))
- To say “all Chinese people think this” or “all black people behave like that” had been thought to be rude as well as ignorant. But Robin DiAngelo positively reveled in the naughtiness of doing it and getting away with doing it because she was doing it against white people.

- And this perspective, that what happened that day was not the behavior of a rogue cop who was subsequently arrested, tried, convicted, and imprisoned for his crime but rather a pulling back of the curtain and a revealing of something in the heart of all white Americans, was an interpretation that DiAngelo, the critical race theorists, and others had primed Americans for. And primed college-aged Americans for in particular. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=378))
- Just as their colleagues in the intersectional arena insisted on the idea that everyone lived in a “cis-heteronormative patriarchy,” so the professors of CRT introduced a set of racialized terms into the academic language and from there into the nation’s language. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=388))
- Twenty-two percent of people who identified as “very liberal” said they thought the police shot at least ten thousand unarmed black men in a year. Among self-identified liberals, fully 40 percent thought the figure was between one thousand and ten thousand. The actual figure was somewhere around ten.20 ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=416))
- By proportion of the population, unarmed black Americans were slightly more likely to be shot by the police than unarmed white Americans. But as figures compiled by the Washington Post Police Shootings database confirm, in the years before the death of George Floyd, more police officers were killed by black Americans than unarmed black Americans were killed by the police.21 ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HSBM23P&location=419))
