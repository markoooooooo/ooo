## Highlights
- Ordinary people don’t do that. It makes no sense. Unless, of course, something has happened to you, unless you know that the world is not what it seems to be, unless you know that you are not what you seem to be. I am guessing that this has already happened to you. I am guessing that you know that, deep down, you are Superman.

- “But here’s the thing. No one will hire Superman. Superman never gets a job. If you come here to study with us, we will privately affirm and even help you cultivate the Superman, but we will also insist that you learn to be Clark Kent. Only Clark gets a job.

- “Have you really read all of these books?” My answer is always the same: “No. A library is not a sign of accomplishment. It is a sign of desire.” ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BCYN31SV&location=167))
- No wonder so many of us are on drugs. We are depressed because we are, deep down, perfectly sane. We are sad because we once saw. We are disgusted because we know better and more than this. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BCYN31SV&location=236))
