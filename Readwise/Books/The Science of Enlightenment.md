- meditation elevates a person’s base level of focus. By focus, I mean the ability to attend to what’s relevant in a given situation. By base level, I mean how focused you automatically get in daily life when you’re not making an effort to be focused. If you’re consistently two or three times more focused in each moment of life, then you’re living two or three times bigger, two or three times richer. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=218))
- you can dramatically extend life—not by multiplying the number of your years, but by expanding the fullness of your moments. Knowing that I have lived with such richness makes the visage of my inevitable death less problematic. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=221))
- you can think of enlightenment as a kind of permanent shift in perspective that comes about through direct realization that there is no thing called “self” inside you. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=236))
- When the sensory experience of the mind-body becomes sufficiently clear and uninhibited, it ceases to be a rigid thing that imprisons your identity. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=242))
- Philip Kapleau’s classic The Three Pillars of Zen, ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=249))
- Let me be clear: enlightenment is real. Not only is it real, but it is something that can be achieved by normal human beings through the systematic practice of meditation. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=257))
- Equanimity is the ability to allow sensory experience to well up without suppression and to pass away without identifying with it. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=365))
- Enlightenment is not a peak from which you descend over time. It is a plateau from which you ascend, further and further as the months, years, and decades pass. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=371))
- I moved into the abbot’s temple, Shinno-in. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=395))
- Kyoto School of Zen philosophy. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=407))
- “You must try to be in this state at all times, even as you go about ordinary activity.” ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=418))
- “As a general principle, any positive state that you experience within the context of silent sitting practice, you must try to attain in the midst of ordinary life.” ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=420))
- He explained to me that there is a natural progression of challenges to attain this: The first is to experience some degree of samadhi during formal sitting. The next is to experience it during simple tasks like cleaning, then to maintain it during more complex tasks like cooking meals, serving guests at the temple, and so forth. The next level of challenge would be to stay in samadhi during small talk. The ultimate challenge would be to stay in samadhi while having important, emotionally charged, social interactions with others. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=422))
- I like to describe mindfulness as a threefold attentional skill set: concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity working together. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=563))
- I learned that impermanence is not merely something that you experience in your sensory circuits. It also informs your motor circuits. It’s a kind of effortless energy that you can “ride on” in daily life. It imparts a bounce to your step, a flow to your voice, and a vibrancy to your creative thought. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=583))
- the ultimate reason to experience liberation is to better serve others. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=594))
- “Neurobiological Substrates Underlying Varieties of Restful Experience,” utilized my distinctive periodic table of sensory events. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=633))
- For example, you can practice meditation while talking to someone. In fact, you could do that in a number of different ways. You can do that by intently focusing on the sights and sounds of that person—so intently focusing on those sights and sounds that you enter into what Martin Buber calls an “I-Thou” relationship with them. I call that approach Focus Out. But that’s just one way that you could meditate while talking to a person. Another way would be to monitor, in a state of high concentration, your mental and emotional reactions to that person. I call that approach Focus In. Yet another way to meditate while talking to a person would be to intentionally create lovingkindness emotion in your body and then taste an expansive flavor of concentration by spreading that pleasant body sensation out into the room, enveloping your interlocutor with love. I call that approach Nurture Positivity. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=781))
- You can also meditate while washing the dishes. You anchor yourself in the physical touch of the water and dishes, along with the sights and sounds of washing, the motion of the water, and the clacking of the dishware. You get into a zone state and become one with the water and the dishes—yet another instance of Focus Out. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=788))
- The Focus Out approach makes it possible to enter a meditative state while driving through traffic. You put all your attention on what’s relevant to driving, such as the sights of the road, the sounds of the other cars, and the physical body sensations of driving, the touch of the steering wheel, the touch of the seat, the physical linkage to the car. That way you can enter a deep state and still be driving safely—indeed more safely than most people. In this case, your meditation practice is the way that you drive. You’re fully focused on the seeing, hearing, and feeling of the drive. ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=791))
- Rigorous research by people in the positive psychology movement has shown that a concentrated state is intrinsically rewarding, and that reward is independent of the content of one’s experience. Boring, even painful, experiences can become interesting and pleasant when experienced in a state of intense concentration. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=795))
- So there are actually four subskills to concentration: learning how to restrict attention to small sensory events, learning how to evenly cover large sensory events, learning how to sustain concentration on one thing for an extended period of time, and learning how to taste a momentary state of concentration with whatever randomly calls your attention. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=829))
- The ultimate personal goal of meditation is to achieve happiness independent of conditions. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=879))
- happiness independent of conditions occurs whenever we have a complete sensory experience. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=887))
- To have a complete experience means to experience something in a state of extraordinary concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. Any ordinary sensory event, when experienced completely, becomes extraordinary and paradoxical: its richness is maximal but its somethingness is minimal. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=888))
- A complete experience of pleasure delivers pure satisfaction but has little substance. A complete experience of pain is deeply poignant but not problematic. A complete experience of desire is desireless. A complete experience of mental confusion nurtures intuitive wisdom. A complete experience of self convinces you there never was a self. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=890))
- The only way we know of a condition is through sensory experience—what we see, hear, and feel on the inside and the outside. Desirable conditions create pleasant sensory experiences. Undesirable conditions create unpleasant sensory experiences. Neutral conditions create neutral sensory experiences. But any sensory experience can, in theory, be a complete experience. And when we’re having complete experiences, we’re happy regardless of the content of the experience. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=892))
- Complete experience is a kind of metapleasure, a pleasure that both unifies and transcends pleasure and pain. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=896))
- So meditation is partially something you do to help yourself at many levels, including the ultimate level, which is to transcend your self. People usually identify with their thoughts and feelings, their minds and their bodies. The thinking mind and the feeling body thus become a prison within which most people spend their lives. Meditation makes it possible to transcend that limited identity, so that the mind and body become a home that you can go in and out of, rather than a prison that you are stuck in. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=904))
- And how do you free your mind-body? By having a complete experience of your mind-body! This is one possible way of viewing the path to enlightenment. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=907))
- That is the basic pattern on this planet: People do not understand how to experience pain fully, that is, without suffering. Suffering distorts their response to the source of the pain, and this distorted response can easily lead to more pain and, hence, more suffering. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=945))
- Meditation allows us to experience pain without suffering and pleasure without neediness. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=949))
- homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1034))
- The Interior Castle of Saint Teresa of Avila, ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1083))
- Cloud of Unknowing, by an anonymous fourteenth-century English author, which gives a very beautiful poetic description of the meditative process. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1085))
- Meister Eckhart, a thirteenth-century Dominican. Eckhart’s writings went unnoticed for many centuries, but he is now appreciated as among the greatest Christian mystics. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KUGQYJO&location=1086))
