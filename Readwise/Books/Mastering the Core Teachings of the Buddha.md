## Highlights
- The essential point about meditation is this: to get anywhere in meditation you need to be able to steady the mind and be present in the present. That's all there is to it and it is largely a question of just doing it. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=677))
- continuous concentration versus moment-to-moment concentration. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=682))
- Let's begin by taking it as a wholesome given that there is some understanding that is completely beyond any ordinary understanding, even beyond the skillful altered states of consciousness that can be attained if we train well in concentration. The next premise is that there are specific practices that can and will lead to that understanding if we simply do them. The third and perhaps most vital premise is that we can do these specific practices and be successful. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=760))
- Insight practice can seem more daunting, complex, or bizarre than other forms of practice. However, it is oddly simple. There are six sense doors. Sensations arise and vanish. Notice this for every sensation. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=783))
- The gold standard for training in morality is how consciously harmless, kind, skillful, and compassionate our intentions, words, and actions are and how well we lead a useful and moral life. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=793))
- The gold standard for training in concentration is how quickly we can enter into specific, skillful, altered states of consciousness on our own meditative power, how long we can stay in them, and how refined, complete, and stable we can make those states. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=794))
- The gold standard for training in wisdom with insight practices is that we can quickly and consistently perceive the true nature of the countless quick sensations that make up our whole reality, regardless of what those sensations are, allowing us to cut to a level of understanding that goes utterly beyond specific conditions but includes them all. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=796))
- Having gained at least enough morality to be temporarily free of agitating negative mind states and enough concentration to steady the mind, turn your attention to the bare truth of the sensations of this moment. This is called insight meditation, which is designed to produce a form of knowledge or wisdom that can transform and free us from our core perceptual misinterpretations of sensate reality. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=801))
- Many people try to make insight practices into an exercise that will produce both insights into the ordinary world and ultimate insights. There are numerous traditions that specifically advocate for this sort of practice that attempts to work on both fronts simultaneously. However, I have concluded that we should not count on ultimate teachings to illuminate or resolve our relative issues or vice versa. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=811))
- Therefore, it is extremely important not only to practice all three trainings, but also not to conflate the relative and ultimate wisdom teachings. Failure to do so causes endless problems and makes progress more difficult. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=813))
- They falsely imagine that by training in insight they have mastered or gone beyond the training in or need for morality. We awaken to the actual truth of our life in all its conventional aspects, so make sure that yours is a life you want to wake up to. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=820))
- The three characteristics of impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self are so central to the Buddha's teachings that it is almost inconceivable how little attention the majority of “insight” meditators give them. I cannot possibly overstate the usefulness of trying again and again to really discern these three qualities of all experience. They are the stuff from which ultimate insight at all stages comes, pure and simple. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=827))
- “Understand the true nature of things,” what I mean is, “Directly perceive the three characteristics.” To perceive them thoroughly and directly is to be awakened. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=831))
- Somehow this exceedingly important message doesn't typically seem to get through to insight meditators, so they spend much time doing anything but looking precisely, moment to moment, into the three characteristics. They may be thinking about something, lost in the stories and tape loops of the mind, trying to work out their stuff, philosophizing, trying to quiet the mind, or who knows what, and this can go on retreat after… ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=832))
- The big message here is: drop the stories. Find a physical object like the breath, the body, pain, or pleasure, some feeling of resistance you may be experiencing, etc., and train yourself to perceive the three characteristics precisely and consistently. Drop to the level of bare… ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=837))

- Regarding impermanence, it is wise to reflect on our own mortality, a common reflection in many Buddhist traditions, for it is useful and true. This is a reflection on ordinary reality and thus an aspect of training in morality that is commonly used to develop motivation to train in insight. I gained some dharmic benefits and relative insights from the one hundred and sixty hours we spend in medical school dissecting a corpse down to… ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=863))
- I mean that sensations arise out of nothing, do their thing, and vanish utterly. Gone. Entirely gone. Then the next sensation arises, does… ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=867))
- Some people can get all into complex wave or particle models here, but do yourself a favor and don't. Just examine your actual experience, especially something nice and physical like the motion and sensations of the breath in the abdomen, the sensations of the tips of the fingers, the lips, the bridge of the nose, beneath the nose and above the lip, or the subtle tingling on the scalp and so on. Instant by instant, try to know when the actual physical sensations are there and when they are not. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=872))
- It turns out they are not there a good bit of the time, and even when they are, they are changing constantly. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=876))
- Being clear about exactly when the physical sensations are present will begin to clarify their slippery counterparts—flickering mental impressions—that help co-create the illusion of continuity, stability, or solidity. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=879))
- This habit of creating a mental impression following any of the physical sensations is the standard way the mind operates on phenomena that are no longer actually there, even mental sensations such as seemingly auditory thoughts, that is, mental talk (our inner “voice”), intentions, and mental images. It is like an echo, a resonance. The mind forms a general impression of the object, and that is what we can think about, remember, and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical pulse. Since I just used this dangerous ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=884))
- “Some people say there is mind. I say there is no mind, but never mind! Heh, heh, heh!” ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=891))
- there are only utterly transient mental sensations. Truly, there is no stable, unitary, discrete entity called “mind” that can be located! ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=893))
- Each one of these sensations (the physical sensation and the mental impression) arises and vanishes completely before another begins, so it is possible to sort out which is which with relatively stable attention dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=895))
- This means that the instant you have experienced something, you can know that it isn't there anymore, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=897))
- There are typically many other momentary sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=899))
- Given that you now know that sensations are vibrating, pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice, every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now know exactly what you are looking for. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=901))
- You have a clear standard. If you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and develop more clarity about exactly when and where there are physical sensations. Spend time with this, as long as it takes. The whole goal is to experience momentariness directly, that is, things flickering, and what those things are doesn't matter one bit! ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=902))
- Interpretation is particularly useless in insight meditation, so you don't have to spend time doing it when you are on the cushion. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=905))
- Thoughts, even supposedly good ones, are just too slippery and seductive most of the time, even for advanced meditators, though if you can avoid getting lost in their content they are as valid a stream of sensate objects for insight practices as any other. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=907))
- When doing insight practices, try to limit yourself to no more than a few minutes of skillful reflection per hour of meditation. This should be more than enough. There are simply no substitutes for this sort of momentum in practice. If you can get that reflection down to no minutes at all, so much the better. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=908))
- How fast are things vibrating? How many sensations arise and vanish each second? ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=911))
- Try it! Count “one, one thousand” and tap with each syllable. So, you now know you can experience at least eight things in a second! You experienced the four syllables and the four taps that went along with them. You probably experienced all sorts of other things also, like sights, sounds, other physical sensations, and a lot more during that one second. Yay! That is insight practice. You are already up to at least eight sensations per second. Yay, you! ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=918))
- Investigate reality that fast and you will learn some seriously cool things. Add in noticing the intentions to tap each of those taps and the mental impressions of all of the sensations you just experienced, and suddenly you are rockin’ it like a boss in the world of insight meditation. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=923))
- There are faster and slower vibrations that may show up, some very fast (maybe up to forty times per second or so) and some very slow (that are actually made up of faster vibrations), but let's just say that one to ten times per second can sometimes be a useful guideline in the beginning. Once you get the hang of it, the faster and slower vibrations are no big deal. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=925))
- However, in the beginning you should go for faster vibrations over slower ones and then later try for broader and more inclusive ones over those that are narrower. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=931))
- Don't worry if things look or feel solid sometimes. Just be with the solidity clearly and precisely, but not too tightly, and that pattern of sensations that implies solidity can start to reveal its impermanence. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=932))
- Be aware of each exact moment in which you experience solidity and its beginning and ending. Remember that each experience of solidity is a discrete, impermanent sensation. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=934))
- Still, the general concept that you are looking for something changing moderately fast but still quite manageable is key. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=936))
- It is also worth noting here that the frequency or rate of vibrations may change often, either getting faster or slower, and that it is worth trying to perceive clearly the beginning and ending of each vibration or pulse of reality. These are actually at least two different sensations! ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=943))
- It is also useful to check out exactly what happens at the bottom, middle, and top of the breath if you are using the breath as an object, and to examine if the frequency remains stable or changes in each phase of the breath. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=945))
- Finding the exact end of the out-breath is a commonly used exercise of great profundity once mastered. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947))
- Never assume that what you have understood is a final, fixed answer. Be alert. Explore carefully and precisely with openness and acceptance. This is the door to understanding. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=947))
- One last thing about vibrations: exploring vibrations can be a lot like any other sport. We can think of it the same way as we would of surfing or playing tennis, and this playful game-like attitude can help a lot. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=949))
- You don't know quite what the next return or wave is going to be like, so pay attention, keep the mind on the pulse of the sensations of your world just as you would on the wave or ball, and keep playing! ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=951))
- you can perceive one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity shatters. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=958))
- In short, when doing insight practices, constantly work to perceive sensations arise and pass as quickly and accurately as you possibly can. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=959))
- With the spirit of a race car driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and still stay on the track, stay on the cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations quickly and accurately. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=960))
- In one of these exercises, I sit quietly in a quiet place, close my eyes, put my right hand on my right knee, my left hand on my left knee, and concentrate just on my two index fingers. Basic dharma theory tells me that it is not possible to perceive both fingers simultaneously; so, with this knowledge, I try to see in each instant which one of the two fingers’ physical sensations are being perceived at any given moment. Once the mind has sped up a bit and become more stable, I try to perceive the arising and passing of each of these sensations. I may do this for half an hour or an hour, just staying with the sensations in my two fingers and perceiving when each sensation is and is not there. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=965))
- the illusion of a separate perceiver is partially supported by one impermanent sensation incorrectly seeming to perceive another impermanent sensation which it follows, such as the sensations in the back of the head incorrectly seeming to perceive the sensations of the front of the head, ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=976))
- the second aspect of dukkha is the key for insight practices, and that is the inherent painful tension that comes because we take the sensate data coming in and misinterpret those sensations in a way that causes us to habitually create the illusion of a permanent, separate, independently functioning (acausal), localized self. This mode of perceiving experience is more painful than the other way that sensate reality can be perceived, in which sensate data imply the exact reverse: that there is naturally occurring, causal, self-perceiving, immediate transience. Insight practices can show us this other, less painful way of perceiving reality, and eventually hardwire it into our systems so that we don't go back to the more painful way which involves the dukkha created by this misperception. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1049))
- Remember that awakening is not a thing or a mind state or a thought, it is an understanding of perspective without some separate entity that perceives. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1061))
- Once you have some mental stability, you can even examine the bare experience of the sensations that make up the stories that spin in your mind and see how unsatisfactory and unsettling it is to try to pretend they are a self or the property of some imagined self. If we continue to habituate ourselves to this understanding moment to moment we may get it into our thick heads and finally awaken. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1082))
- At a rate of one to ten times per second, try to experience exactly how you know that you wish to do something other than simply face your current experience as it is. Moment to moment, try to discern every little uncomfortable shift, urge, impulse, and tension that prods your mind into fantasizing about the past or future or stopping the meditation entirely. For that meditation period, they become my prey and nourishment, opportunities to understand something extraordinary about reality, and so I do my very best to let none of them arise and pass without clearly perceiving and acknowledging the basic sense of dissatisfaction in relation to them. So, for that period try to: ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1097))

So, for that period try to: ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1100))
- However, I have found that this kind of investigation pays off in ways I could never have imagined. Later, I will explain a stage called “the Knowledges of Suffering”, aka “the Dark Night”. If you find yourself having trouble with that phase of practice, come back here and try this exercise, as it can turn the tables on something that otherwise might turn the tables on you. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1109))
- Even the most pleasant sensations have a tinge of misery to them, not only because they end, but also due to the strange way we hold our minds to create a sense of a stable self in a changing world, so look for it at the level of bare experience. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1113))
- Just knowing in each instant how you know that pain is dissatisfactory and miserable can be profound practice. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1116))
- Emptiness, for all its mysterious-sounding connotations, means that reality is empty of, devoid of, or lacking a permanent, separate, independent, acausal, autonomous self. It doesn't mean that reality is not there, but that reality is not there in the way it may appear to us to be. Solidity and permanence are mistaken perceptions. That the “watcher” (whatever seems to be observing things, aka the “perceiving subject”) is a thing separable and independent from what is perceived is mistaken. However, all of this is not merely an illusion, though how the “watcher” is perceived and how sensate experience is interpreted initially is clearly delusional, as good practice eventually may reveal. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1124))

([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1126))
- One of my teachers wisely said, “If you are observing it, then by definition it isn't you.” Notice that all of what we call “reality” seems to be something we can observe. The hints don't get any better than this. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1163))
- There are absolutely no sensations that can observe other sensations. (Notice that your experiential reality is made up entirely of sensations.) There are no special sensations that are uniquely in control of other sensations. There are no sensations that are fundamentally split off or separable from other sensations occurring at that moment. To begin to unravel this mystery through the development of better perceptual skills is to begin to awaken. Simply put, reality with a sense of a separate watcher is delusion, and reality just as it is, is awakening. With systematic debunking through insight practices of the illusion of some sense of a permanent, separate, independently existing self, we learn to perceive things as they are naturally. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1165))

- With systematic debunking through insight practices of the illusion of some sense of a permanent, separate, independently existing self, we learn to perceive things as they are naturally. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1170))
- When we get good at perceiving them all as they are, including everything that typically seems to be on “this side”, the whole thing can flip around, and suddenly all the sensations that seemed to be a “self” or property of that “self” are perceived as just sensations—natural, causal, transient—and not a self or permanent thing at all. In fact, they never were, and this can be clearly perceived by skilled practitioners. It is in some ways very much like the classic drawing by William Ely Hill that can be viewed two ways, either as a young woman or as an old woman. Whichever you see first tends to stick in your mind and then it can be tricky to see the other one until someone points out the features that make up the other face, and then suddenly you see the same set of lines in a totally different way. Insight practices create effects very much like that: same sensations, totally different implications. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1175))

- The illusions are in how we misconceive and misperceive phenomena versus how they actually exist. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1186))
- It's not that the constellation labeled “me”, or “you”, a grouping of physical and mental components, does not exist and function in some ordinary sense. It's that none of those components exist independently or acausally, which is how ignorance conceives of them. Ultimate unfindability of the components of reality in no way precludes their conventional existence! ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1187))
- Another very important, related thing: the creation of the sense of an ultimate, permanent, continuous, stable self is a process of identification, not a stable entity in and of itself. It is like a bad habit, in this case a habitual misperception, but it doesn't exist as something that can be found beyond a shifting pattern of mere sensations and causality. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1191))
- By understanding our bare experience more clearly the process of identification can stop, and by identification, I mean misperceiving various aspects of experience such as body and thoughts as being equivalent to a “self”. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1195))
- Any thoughts with “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine” in them should be understood to be just thoughts that come and go. They are simply qualities of manifestation, like flavors of ice cream. It is not that chocolate is good and vanilla is bad; all flavors of experience are just flavors, and sometimes the flavor of the moment is “I”, “me”, “mine”, and the like, and even those flavors don't constitute a real “I”, “me”, or “mine”. So, if those qualities arise, just notice them come and go like everything else. They never were an “I”, “me”, or “mine” and never could be.

- Allow vibrations to show themselves, and tune in to the sense that you don't have to struggle for them to arise. Reality just continues to change on its own. That's really it. Investigate this again and again until you get it. Notice that this applies to every sensation that you experience, including all the core things we think are really “me”, such as effort, the sensations that make up the process of attending itself, analysis, investigation, questioning, and the like. These are more profound instructions than they may initially appear. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1231))
- While we can direct the mind to penetrate phenomena with great precision and energy, we can also sit quietly and allow reality to just show itself as it is.

- A useful teaching is conceptualizing reality as six sense doors: touch, taste, seeing, hearing, smelling, and thought. It may seem odd to consider thought as a sense door, but this is much more reasonable than the assumption that thoughts are a “me” or “mine” or in complete control. Just treat thoughts as more sensations coming in which must be understood to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. In this strangely useful framework, there are not even ears, eyes, skin, nose, tongue,… ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1252))

- I realize that most people go into meditation looking for stability, happiness, and comfort in the face of their own existence. I have just said that I have spent many years cultivating extreme experiential instability, careful awareness of the minutiae of my suffering and the clear perception that I don't even exist as a separate or continuous entity. Why this would be a good idea is a very complex topic that I will try to deal with… ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1260))

- As we apply effort to practice and build concentration, our mind will grow stronger. This in general is a great thing, but can also have a downside, which is that however we happen to be when our mind is more energetic and concentrated is written more strongly into our brain, and thus our habits and personality. Therefore, when cultivating an energetic and concentrated mind, guard it well and direct it to skillful practices and ways of being so that skillfulness is written deep into the mind, rather than things like rage, jealousy, terror, or conceit. Do not allow the mind to go down unskillful tracks and channels for longer than it takes to honestly recognize that it is doing that, or those harmful mental habits and tendencies will be written in your mind with that same power. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1322))
- Thus, when practicing, particularly on retreat, but also in daily life, be careful and respectful of the power of an energetic and concentrated mind. Use it skillfully, just as you would any powerful tool. Imagine that a very strong mind is like an acetylene cutting torch—useful for cutting through things (like delusion), yet capable of hurting self and others if not properly handled. Keep this analogy in mind, remember training in morality, and you will likely do much better in your practice. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1332))
- If you are trying to perceive the sensations that make up your experience clearly and to know what they are, you are balancing energy and concentration, and faith and wisdom. Due to energy, the mind is alert and attentive. Due to concentration, it is stable. Faith here may also mean acceptance, and wisdom here is clear comprehension. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1340))
- The five spiritual faculties have also been presented in another order that can be useful: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. In this order, they apply to each of the three trainings, the first of which, as discussed earlier, is morality. We have faith that training in morality is a good idea and that we can do it, so we exert energy to live up to a standard of clear and skillful living. We realize that we must pay attention to our thoughts, words, and deeds in order to do this, so we try to be mindful of them. We realize that we often fail to pay attention, so we try to increase our ability to concentrate on how we live our life. In this way, through experience, we become wiser in a relative sense, learning how to live a good and useful life. Seeing our skill improve and the benefits it has for our life, we generate more faith, and so on. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1348))
- With respect to training in concentration, we may have faith that we might be able to attain high states of consciousness, so we sit down on a cushion and energetically try to stabilize our attention and tune in to skillful qualities. We realize that we cannot stabilize our attention without mindfulness of our object and of the qualities of the state we wish attain. We develop strong concentration by consistently stabilizing our attention. We attain high states of concentration and thus gain a direct understanding of how to navigate in that territory and the meaning and purpose of doing so. Our success creates more faith, and so we apply energy to further develop our concentration abilities. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1354))
- With the faith borne of the experience yielded by strong concentration, we begin to think it might be possible to awaken, so we energetically explore all the sensations that make up our world. With an alert and energetic mind, we mindfully explore this heart, mind, and body just as it is now. Reality becomes more and more interesting, so our concentration grows, and this combination of the first four produces fundamental wisdom. Wisdom leads to more faith, and the cycle goes around again. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1359))
- It is aptly said that when balanced and perfected, the five spiritual faculties as they apply to insight training are a sufficient cause for awakening. ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1366))

- Here are some valuable tips for successful noting: Don't get too neurotic about whether you have exactly the correct noting label for what arises. Stick to simple noting and move on. Noting should be as consistent and continuous as possible, perhaps one to five times per second (speed and an ability to keep noting no matter what arises are very important). Anything that derails your noting practice deserves fearless noting the next time it arises. Note honestly and precisely. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1423))
- So, once mindfulness has made these dhammas, these moments of experience, a bit clearer, we can know that things come and go, don't satisfy, and ain't us. ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1447))
- If we did not understand at least one of the three characteristics of each of the sensations that make up a phenomenon, no matter what it is, it is a hindrance. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1476))
- All phenomena, if properly investigated, can be a source of wisdom and demonstrate the nature of ultimate truth. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1479))
- When we know deeply that all of these are of the nature of ultimate truth, phenomena cease to be a fundamental problem. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1480))
- Specifically, noticing the many little rapid sensations that make up sensory desire, ill will, sloth, torpor, restlessness, worry, and doubt is insight practice. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1481))
- Sometimes noticing what those really are is more profound and useful than noticing aspects of our intended primary object. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1482))
- There is an important shift that happens when we go from caring so much about what is going on, such as judgment, boredom, restlessness, or whatever, and switch to caring about whether we knew the sensations of what was going on. ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1483))
- A meditator who doesn't get this might get all stressed about their mind wandering. A more seasoned insight meditator is excited when they can note, “wandering” and perceive the wandering as sensations. See the difference? ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1485))
- The aliens shooting us is what happens when we do not see their true nature, as they become a hindrance, binding us in misperception for however long we fail to shoot them. Some may even take us out of the game (causing us to stop practicing entirely). ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1503))
- The seemingly huge aliens that take multiple hits to kill are our own big issues, those things that are difficult for us to break into their composite sensations, termed “bosses” in video game parlance. Being penalized for shooting wastefully is what can happen if we note sensations that we didn't experience because we fell into repetitive, imprecise, mantralike noting habits. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1504))
- Further, the speed, precision, and playful attitude required for video games is exactly like the feel of well-done insight practice. If you watch a kid playing a fast alien-shooting game, you will notice that they are really going for it. They are shooting very fast and thinking of nothing but doing that. This is exactly the sort of dedication and passion that helps with insight practice as we delve… ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1507))

- The motto, “note first, ask questions later,” is so helpful if we are to keep practicing precisely without getting lost in the stories. Again, off the cushion the stories can have some value if not taken too seriously. On the cushion, take no prisoners: “Note ‘em all, and let God sort ‘em out!” This is seemingly extreme but actually very… ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1514))
- Where “The Analogy of Shootin’ Aliens” breaks down is that these aliens want attention, recognition, understanding, and acceptance, and who could blame them? They come to us so that we will welcome them clearly and openly, but if we fail to do this they can get very troublesome. Their little alien hearts are being broken when we don't get to know them as they are, so who can blame them when they get mischievous and try to trick us into paying more attention to them… ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1518))
- Thus, rather than killing our aliens by shooting them, we give them what they want by acknowledging, noticing, or noting them. We don't invite the pretty ones to stay with us forever, nor do we ignore the boring aliens. We don't kick out the ugly ones, either. Like a politician on the campaign trail, we extend a hand to all, say, “Hello!” and then quickly do this for lots of… ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1522))

- If you are on the runway to Crazyland from jacking the energy too high for too long, figure out how to gently settle into the things that are arising naturally on their own rather than pouring energy into practice. Reality is constantly showing up in amazing detail, and if your mind is receptive, all that detail will reveal itself without you having to do much of anything, and that is the best kind of energy—energy that doesn't really feel like energy but gets the job done. ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1547))
- One of the keys to mobilizing energy is motivation, so if energy is lacking, try to remember why you are doing all of this. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1550))

- to walk the spiritual path with a sense of joy, a sense of wonder, a bit of a smile and especially a sense of humor is good for you and everyone who must be near you. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1564))
- Sure, there will be hard times and difficulties that can have good lessons to teach us, but be open to the joy and happiness life can bring. ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1565))
- Natural wonder really helps many things, including and specifically investigation. Reality is simply amazing. Our minds are amazing. The vast intricacy of what happens in each moment is truly remarkable. When you sit, sit with amazement at what is going on, like a vast, complex, rich work of moving, fluxing art. When you walk, walk with a sense of wonder at all the little aspects of movement, of balancing, of a body moving through the air, through a changing landscape, with all the little facets that make that up. The feel of our foot touching the floor, earth, sand, grass, moss, leaves, stones, or whatever we are walking on is simply amazing. Air is amazing. Breathing is amazing. That we think is amazing. Food is amazing. Have you really looked at a glass of water lately? When tasting, smelling, hearing, seeing, feeling, thinking, speaking, eating, and doing anything else, really tune in to how fascinating it is to perceive all these things. This natural curiosity, this enchantment with the experience of the ordinary world, is total gold. ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1567))
- Practitioners who incorporate natural wonder into their practice will do much better, have a much better time, and be much more fun to be around than those who don't. Reconnect with that effortless wonder that children have about themselves and their world. If things get dark, difficult, painful, dull, lifeless, heartless, frustrating, edgy, or boring, reconnect with this meaning of the word rapture and see if you can find something amazing about every moment: you will be glad you did. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1574))
- All the strange physical sensations, pains, pleasures, movements, visions, lights, perception distortions, energetic phenomena, muscle tensions, etc., which may or may not show up as a result of spiritual practice are all just raptures. Repeat, just raptures. Don't get hung up on them or spin stories out of them, as compelling as they can be, and don't think that they are required or a mark of authenticity or spiritual superiority either: they are not. The sensations that make them up come, go, don't satisfy, and ain't you. Most are just byproducts of meditation and strong concentration. Some produce zero wisdom. Some can be disorienting and troubling. Some, of course, can provide deep insights into the truth of things, but don't get stuck on these. Many of these lessons show up once and never again. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1583))
- Some people can get so serious and fixated on suffering that they fight the pleasant raptures and even cling to the difficult ones. Don't do this! The joy and pleasure that may arise in meditation have wonderful healing aspects to them, and can lead to deep tranquility, concentration, and equanimity, which are all good things that support further practice. On the other hand, you don't want to cling to pleasant states either, as you will just get stuck and be frustrated when they end, which they always do. ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1589))
- In general, if you try to fight or cling to raptures you will get stuck, and if you can accept them as they are, you will benefit. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1592))
- Preoccupation with pleasant sensations can cause us to become vapid bliss-junkies. Preoccupation with unpleasant sensations can cause us to become dark and depressed. Preoccupation with neutral sensations can cause us to become dull and emotionally flat. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1598))
- As mentioned before, concentration can produce great stability and consistency of mind, and this can lead to equanimity, which is that quality of mind that is okay with things; or balanced in the face of any internal or external painful, pleasurable, or neutral condition, including a lack of equanimity. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1634))
- Equanimity also relates to a lack of struggle even when struggling, to effortlessness even in effort, to peacefulness even when there is no tranquility. When equanimity is well developed, we are not frightened of being afraid, concerned by being worried, irritated by being annoyed, pissed off by being angry, etc. Phenomena do not disturb space or even fundamentally disturb themselves from a certain point of view. I have wept and yet been very equanimous about it, if that helps clarify what I am talking about. Equanimity can be regarded as a meta-perspective able to hold everything else. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1636))
- There can be great value in learning to include the space that holds things, rather than just being caught up in the things themselves. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1642))

- Check out the YouTube videos of Ayya Tathaaloka, as that's the good stuff. Being influenced by gentler approaches really helped me with the equanimity part of the equation, which was not my forte, and I recommend that you find something for yourself that serves to balance my vibe. Looking back, I feel that balancing my practice by exposure to these sorts of influences facilitated a settling into what was happening naturally, and that my practice would have been much more difficult without exposure to that sort of gentler ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1657))
- Once again, we are back to knowing this moment just as it is. This “just as it is” quality is related to mindfulness and to equanimity. In the end, we must accept the truth of our specific lives, of our minds, of our neuroses, of our “defilements”, of impermanence, of suffering, and of emptiness. We must accept this, and this is what they are talking about when they say just “open to it”, “be with it”, “let it be”, “let it go”, and so on. ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1661))
- “Let it go” means, “Don't artificially solidify a bunch of transient sensations.” It does not mean, “Stop feeling or caring,” nor does it mean, “Pretend that the noise in your mind is not there.” ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1668))
- Reflect on these previous three paragraphs now and often, as many errors on the spiritual path come from not understanding the points made therein. Too often there is an imbalance between the first three (mindfulness, investigation, and energy), and the last three (tranquility, concentration, and equanimity). Most aspiring insight meditators are, to be honest, way too slack about the first three. Just so, some gung-ho meditators like the people who have tended to be attracted to this book may get into trouble when they don't cultivate enough acceptance, balance, and peace, related to the last three. When people focus for too long only on the middle factor, rapture, they become bliss-junkies. When they fail to include rapture in their practice, they often get darker and gloomier despite otherwise good effort. In short, it is critical to cultivate all seven factors. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1677))
- If you are frying yourself on the path of insight, as evidenced by becoming uptight, wound up, reactive, cranky, angry, frustrated, edgy, or nervous, then it is time to ease up, back off, learn concentration practices, do some loving-kindness or similar practices (described later), and cultivate the skillful aspects of the last three factors and perhaps a bit more rapture in the “stop and smell the roses” sense. Many hardcore meditators will ignore this piece of advice to their detriment, assuming it is only by being plugged into 100,000 volts and flipping on the big switch that anything good will ever happen. Numerous points along the way should help elucidate how to find this balance and the markers of progress versus being stuck. ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1686))
- One last thing about equanimity: its near enemy, its deadening impostor, is indifference or apathy. Real equanimity is accepting the full range of the heart and experience, whereas indifference is dry, flat, chilly, dissociative, robotic, and heartless. Real equanimity is extremely honest about what is going on. It is very human, very down-to-earth, very full-spectrum, and very ordinary in most ways. This point is frequently misunderstood. However, being accepting of the full range of the heart doesn't mean acting on whatever impulse comes up. Act only on the impulses of the heart that seem genuinely skillful and kind. Real equanimity is even accepting of the fluxing sensations that make up flatness, strangely enough, but it is more honest about them. This is a fine line, but the point remains. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1692))
- To balance and perfect the seven factors of awakening is sufficient cause for awakening. Thus, checking in from time to time with this list and seeing how you are doing and what might need improvement is a good idea. Just having this list in the back of your mind can be helpful. Furthermore, the seven factors of awakening make for great meditation description and categorization that guides the process of self-correction. ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1704))
- For example, we might say, “That last sit was characterized by a moderate degree of mindfulness, a pretty high degree of investigation, moderate energy, not very good rapture, poor tranquility, moderately good concentration, and a pretty low degree of equanimity.” ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1707))
- While it might be possible to be too hypervigilant about the factors, most practitioners would benefit from increasing the degree to which they monitor them in their practice sessions and life in general. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1716))
- It is important to note that only one of the seven factors, namely investigation of the three characteristics, distinguishes training in concentration from training in fundamental insight. ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1717))
- Just to review, the scope of the first training, morality, is the ordinary world, the conventional world, the world that we are all familiar with before we even consider more specialized topics such as meditation. The goal is to think, speak, and act in ways that are conducive to the reduction of suffering as well as the welfare of ourselves and others. The scope of the second training, concentration, is to focus on very specific and limited objects of meditation and thus attain specific altered states of consciousness that cultivate positive mental qualities and reduce negative ones. The scope of the third training, that of insight or wisdom, is to shift to perceiving reality at the level of individual sensations, perceive their three characteristics, and thus attain profound insights into the nature of reality and realize stages of awakening. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1746))
- There is also the type of renunciation associated with insight practices, in which we are willing to break from the gross conceptual way of working that is helpful for the scope of the ordinary world, break from the more restricted and refined conceptual and attentional way of working that is necessary to attain stable concentration, and move to perceiving sensations individually and directly, seeing their true nature, however they may present. It is a radical antithesis to the way that some might conceive of renunciation, which can sometimes become aversive, as it involves a commitment to being here, in this body, in this space, in this life, at this time, and making this radical commitment again and again. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1780))
- While “awakening” generally sounds very appealing, it suddenly sounds strange in the context of seeing all sensations as being utterly transient, a source of pain if we make artificial dualities out of them, and if we mistake transient sensations for an experientially stable, independent self. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1786))
- For example, rather than popping a cold beer at the end of a hard day, we could sit down and bathe our body and mind in as much healing bliss and peace as we can stand for as long as we wish. If we master concentration practices, we have those options. ([Location 1823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1823))
- Rather, I define awakening as permanently eliminating the basic perceptions that either duality or unity is the answer, and thus attaining to permanent realizations that are unshakable within the limits of biology. Awakening has nothing whatsoever to do with how things manifest and everything to do with basic understanding of those things. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1840))
- When doing insight practices, it doesn't matter so much if thoughts of past or future arise, so long as we are not fascinated by their content, notice that the experiences of thoughts occur now, and notice the true nature of the individual sensations that make up those thoughts. ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1849))
- Why do we practice? We're dissatisfied, we hurt, we sense there must be something greater, or a better way to address suffering, or we can no longer lie to ourselves about our situation and the stark predicament of what awaits us if it isn't here yet, such as sickness, aging, and death. It is just that simple. ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1925))
- Why do we do anything? Because of dukkha, variously translated as dissatisfaction, discontent, misery, suffering, stress. ([Location 1927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1927))
- To understand this first truth is to understand the whole of the spiritual path, so take the time to investigate it. ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1931))
- At the most fundamental level, which is the most useful for doing insight practices, at some habitual level, we wish desperately that there was some separate, permanent self, and we spend huge amounts of time doing our best to prop up this illusion. This consumes surprising amounts of mental processing power. However, this wish for a stable “this” side, a stable observer, a stable “me” is largely unconscious initially. Our job is to make it conscious so we can see what it is doing and how that feels. For this largely unconscious process to function, we habitually ignore much useful sensate information about our reality and invest our mental impressions and simplifications of reality with more power and importance than they necessarily have. It is this illusion that adds a problematic element to the normal and understandable ways in which we go about trying to be happy. We constantly struggle with reality because we misunderstand it, that is, because reality misunderstands itself. ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1938))
- The big question is, “Is there some understanding that can make a difference in my experience?” Yes, or we wouldn't be bothering with all of this. ([Location 1946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1946))
- More than just motivating for spiritual practice, tuning in to suffering is spiritual practice! ([Location 1950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1950))
- Many people start meditating and then get frustrated with how much suffering and pain they experience, never knowing that they are starting to understand something important about themselves and reality. ([Location 1950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1950))
- They don't realize that things on the cushion tend to get worse before they get better. Thus, they get nowhere, as they reject the very truths they must deeply understand to obtain the peace they are seeking. They reject the valid insights that they themselves have gained through valid practice. I suspect that this is one of the greatest and most common stumbling blocks on the spiritual path. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1953))
- There is a flip side to suffering that can help, and that is compassion, the wish to be free of suffering. Wherever there is suffering there is compassion, though most of the time it is distorted by the confused logic of the process of identification and illusory separation which is based on poor perception. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1956))
- The second noble truth is the cause of suffering, in Pali tanha, variously translated as desire, craving, clinging, grasping, fixating, or attachment. These translations are mostly inadequate, but they are getting at something. From a relative perspective, we hang on to what is pleasurable and try to avoid or push away what interrupts that pleasure. We want things to be other than they are because we perceive the world through the odd paradigm of the illusion of the split of the perceiver and the perceived. ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1960))
- But if common sense is ignored, craving non-craving can produce a refined yet toxic aversion that produces neurotic, self-righteous, repressed ascetics instead of balanced, kind meditators. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1967))
- As stated earlier, a helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice and of reality related to kindness. You see, wherever there is desire there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is compassion, the desire for the end of our own and others’ suffering. You can experience this. There is a close relationship between suffering, desire, and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and worth investigating. ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1977))
- We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dog chasing its tail. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be “over there”. Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there, to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the illusory sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. ([Location 1981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1981))
- When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from “there” (or even “here”), a mental pressure that attempts to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because the split doesn't exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful, and this is fundamental aversion. ([Location 1985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1985))
- When boring or apparently uninteresting sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out altogether and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the imagined split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place. ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1988))
- These strict definitions of fundamental attraction, aversion, and ignorance are very important, particularly for when I discuss the various models of the stages of awakening. Given the illusion, it seems that these unskillful mental reactions will help in a lasting way. Remember that the only thing that will fundamentally help is to understand the three characteristics to the degree that makes the difference, and the three characteristics are manifesting right here. ([Location 1991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1991))
- Do you remember reading above that suffering motivates everything we do? We could also say that everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part of the fundamentally empty nature of reality. That doesn't mean that everything we do is skillful; that is a whole different issue. ([Location 1994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=1994))
- The more wisdom or understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect compassion and the more the results will turn out well. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2001))
- The more greed, hatred, delusion, or lack of understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect the distorted aspect of desire and the more suffering there will likely be. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2003))
- When taking action of body, speech, or mind, examine what the consequences might be for yourself and others, and then take responsibility for those consequences. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2009))
- Remember the simplicity of the training in morality, which boils down to: if you can't help, at least do no harm. Train in kindness, generosity, honesty, and clarity, and gain balance and wisdom from the other two trainings as you go. ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2011))
- Connect with the part of your heart that just wishes the suffering would end and feel that deeply, especially as it manifests in the body. Just this can be profound practice. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2014))
- The point is to take the desire to be happy and free of suffering and use its energy to do skillful practices that can make this happen, rather than getting caught in old unexamined patterns of searching for happiness where deep down we know very well we will not find it. ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2020))
- Also, if you can remember that everyone wants happiness and freedom from suffering, you will further facilitate the demolition of the false separation that ignorance imposes between “me” and “other”. ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2022))
- Practices based on compassion facilitate and inspire all aspects of our practice to work for freedom from suffering for all involved. The three trainings are skillful and can inform the whole of our life. By following them we may come to the end of many forms of suffering and be in a much better position to help others do the same. ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2024))
- Be kind, honest, clear, and compassionate in your every action of body, speech, and mind and in all contexts, and if you can't do that, at least do no harm. ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2048))
- The more of our lives we integrate with the spiritual path, the better. ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2050))
- The concentration section contains three things we saw in the five spiritual faculties and the seven factors of awakening: right energy, right concentration, and right mindfulness. These teachings are designed to facilitate attaining access to the jhanas and to be able to eliminate the suffering that those temporary but skillful states can eliminate. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2051))
- The wisdom section has the two last parts of the path: right view and right intention. These two are often rendered in different ways, but the meaning is the same: understand the truth of your experience and aspire to kindness and wisdom in your thoughts and deeds. These eliminate the fundamental and all-pervasive suffering that comes from fundamental ignorance. Three types of suffering, three trainings to address them. Again, simple but powerful. ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2054))
- From a pure insight perspective, neither one is more holy or more of a source of truth than the other, but when we do the experiment we will quickly realize what works for us. “Works” in this case means that we can keep up being able to see the true nature of the numerous quick sensations that make up our reality. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2097))
- These are also impermanent, and if we are good at this we may even see our visual world presenting itself like the frames of a movie or a complex, flickering, organic patchwork of shifting impressions. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2104))
- The best time to meditate is any time you can. ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2137))
- The best place to meditate is wherever you can, and the best duration is for as long as possible or necessary for you to get what you wish out of it. ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2137))
- I have concluded that five minutes of really engaged, clear, and focused practice in poor circumstances can often produce more benefits for me than an hour of poor, vague, and distracted practice in “optimal conditions”.

## New highlights added July 23, 2022 at 10:11 PM
- If you want to build momentum, don't take pauses in the practice, as they will cost you much more than you think they could. Stopping for ten minutes to slack off after an hour sit might cost you all the momentum you gained during that sit and perhaps more! Be mindful every friggin’ second from the moment you get up to the moment you go to sleep and in all transition periods—getting up off the cushion, brushing your teeth, walking to the meditation hall, eating, bathing, peeing, dressing, etc.—those who make use of every moment and every context will make vastly more progress, on average, than those who don't, even if those other people are still doing the same walking and sitting sessions. When applying this sort of advice, be sure to keep the seven factors in mind and balance them skillfully. ([Location 2450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2450))
- There is nothing like interacting with others to show us our blind spots in relation to our issues, whether we are great meditators or not. ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2497))
- The crucial point is to realize that great practice can occur in conditions far from perfect, particularly if we realize that all the sensations that make up these inputs and our reactions to them are all worthy of investigation and thus as much a source of ultimate and often relative wisdom as any other sensations.

There is also Tathagatha in San Jose, California. ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2518))
- Reminders: 1) Don't indulge in your crap! 2) When in doubt or struggling, note those sensations and everything else. 3) If you have a question, the answer is in the three characteristics. 4) Analysis is not the same as practice. 5) Practice at all times when awake; be mindful during transitions between sessions. 6) When nobody is around, practice just as hard: this is for you, not them. 7) Remember how precious these moments are and how rare the opportunity to go on retreat is.

- in lotus position, in half-lotus position, sitting “Indian Style” with our legs crossed, in the “Burmese” or “friendly” position which is like the cross-legged position except that our feet are both on the floor one in front of the other, in a kneeling position with or without a bench, etc. ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2677))
- Do not underestimate walking meditation. In fact, most people who go on retreats where there is walking practice totally blow it when it comes to the walking, as they don't think of it as being useful or as powerful as sitting, but in this they err. Walking has so many obvious, clear, strong, complicated, full, rich sensations occurring that it would seem hard to really screw it up. ([Location 2709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2709))
- Yet, as the strength of people's effort at moment-to-moment concentration and investigation can paradoxically fall off in comparison to sitting, this break in the continuity of mindfulness can cause people to regress in their practice and throw away many easy opportunities for insight. ([Location 2712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2712))
- Of all the insights I ever had in my whole practice to date, the very most important one happened while walking. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2714))
- Take walking meditation seriously and you will maintain and increase your hard-earned momentum from sitting. Slack off and you will lose momentum and fail to learn all the incredible lessons that walking practice can offer. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2714))
- You are not free. You are floundering. Without discipline, without resolve, you are unlikely to get past some of the difficult hurdles that stand between you and success in any of these trainings. ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2726))
- I have found it extremely valuable, particularly when sitting down to do formal meditation, to state to myself at the beginning of the session exactly what I am doing, what I hope to attain by it, and why attaining that is a good idea. I do this formally and clearly, either aloud or silently to myself. Having done practice with and without such resolutions, I have come to the definite conclusion that they can make a huge difference in my practice. One of my favorite resolutions goes something like this: I resolve that for this hour I will consistently investigate the sensations that make up reality to attain to liberating insights for the benefit of myself and all beings. ([Location 2728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2728))
- We wish to be in the company of fellow adventurers rather than be lone wanderers in strange lands. ([Location 2759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2759))
- It is awakening that finally makes the difference and was, according to the Buddha himself, the whole reason for all of this. ([Location 2789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2789))
- I was at one of these small group meetings where everyone was talking about their neurotic stuff. In a moment of feeling like I might be able to add something useful, I said in a loud and exasperated voice, “The breath! Is anyone trying to notice the breath?” They just looked at me like I was out of my mind and went back to whining about their psychological issues. Here was a roomful of otherwise accomplished adults who somehow had been functionally transformed into needy and pathetic children without any obvious ability to deal with their lives or follow very basic instructions. Beware of meditation cultures that consistently encourage this in people. It is a mark of something gone horribly wrong. ([Location 2932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2932))
- My emphasis on also making time for insight practices is to counterbalance the general trend for most insight practitioners’ practice to be almost entirely about moderately neurotic, largely ineffective, spiritually rationalized, hyper-idealistic wallowing in their emotional pain or attempting to bypass it altogether in a blinding golden haze of Buddhist-inspired fantasy. This sort of practice often impairs both real psychological and emotional maturation and deep insight. ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2959))
- Christopher Titmuss’ Light on Enlightenment). ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2976))
- If we would just go into finely discerned sensate reality and try to see the three characteristics of each sensation that makes up experience, we might begin to understand reality at a level that makes the difference. Effectively encouraging students to shift their attention from fixation on and identification with content to working with direct experience as it arises is probably the hardest yet most important job of the meditation teacher. I sometimes wonder how many teachers have mostly given up trying to do this. ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2977))
- When we meditators on retreat focus on content instead of on grounding the mind in the objects of meditation (which just might produce the deep insights that will make the big difference we seek), we basically let our minds go, and go they do. ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2980))
- Years go by, and our practice “deepens”, not into insight territory, but into epoxy-like faith in and further fixation on content. We learn how to “talk Buddhist”. We learn the culture of Buddhism in just the same way that we learned the culture of transpersonal therapy, transactional analysis, or French existentialism. We become fascinated with our growing knowledge of Pali, our fancy brass bell from Nepal, or our knowledge of tantric iconography. We have taken bodhisattva vows 108 times. ([Location 2986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2986))
- Moreover, we can go on like this for enough time that we develop quite a retreat résumé but little or no insight, and then eventually become trapped in this. ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=2999))
- We get stuck in the muck of our rationalizations, the misapplied lingo, the sugarcoated dogma, the role of teacher, and the cultural trappings about which we have become experts. ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3008))
- From this point, it can become nearly impossible for us to learn anything, as we are now trapped in the very teachings that were originally designed to free us from just such a situation. ([Location 3009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3009))
- Thus, most teachers won't say something as straightforward as, “Well, when I was meditating, I spent some time lost in the stories and tape-loops of my mind. This was terrible and I got nowhere but nutty. However, one day a senior teacher straightened me out and convinced me to ground my mind in the specific sensations that make up the objects of meditation and examine impermanence. After some days of consistent and diligent practice using correct technique, I began to directly penetrate the three illusions of permanence, satisfactoriness, and self, and my world began to be broken down into the mind-moments and vibrations that I always thought were just talk. By paying careful attention to bare phenomena arising and passing moment after quick moment, I progressively moved through the stages of insight and got my first taste of awakening. Thus, if you spin in content and don't realize the three characteristics, you are wasting your time and mine. This is just the way it is. If you develop strong concentration on the primary object and investigate the three characteristics consistently, this will almost certainly produce insight. This is just the way it is. Any questions?” ([Location 3024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3024))
- A quick digression here: awakening is about understanding the fundamental nature of all sensate experiences, and what they happen to be is ultimately completely and utterly irrelevant to awakening. Thus, very awakened beings understand something fundamental about whatever arises or however their lives manifest, that is, its impermanence, emptiness, luminosity, groundlessness, or however they wish to describe it. However, they have no more knowledge about the specifics of the world than they have acquired in just the way that anyone else acquires knowledge about the specifics of this world. They can even have all sorts of psychological baggage to deal with, and this is probably the norm. ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3056))
- Further, we may not gain the benefits of the only thing that does make a lasting difference in ending fundamental suffering and bringing the quiet joy of understanding, which is mastery of insight practice and thus awakening. ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3077))
- a dangerous notion that pervades many spiritual circles is that it is bad to want to awaken, and that no discipline, effort, or application of a technique could produce awakening. These notions are completely absurd and have paralyzed or preempted the practice of far too many. I believe these ideas have come from an extremely confused misunderstanding of causality and of the “sudden” and “gradual” schools of thought. “Sudden awakening” is exceedingly rare, and, I will claim, had to involve prior effort and specific prior causes, even if the practitioner doesn't subsequently remember or recognize what those causes were or the effort that was exerted. Anyone who has really gotten into any Buddhist teachings, whether Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana, will know firsthand that all require a tremendous amount of effort just like every other spiritual path. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3079))
- As one of my teacher's teachers put it, “In the end, you must give up even the desire for awakening, but not too soon!” Sutta 131 in the Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha (MN 131) is called “One Fortunate Attachment”, and in it the Buddha clearly states that making effort to realize the truth of your experience is an extremely good idea. He also goes on and on about the three characteristics—fancy that! ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3086))
- There is no such thing as the breath or an image of Green Tara from the point of view of insight practices, as these are just fresh streams of impermanent and transient sensations that are crudely labeled “breath” or “Green Tara”. But, for developing the second training of concentration, we ignore impermanence and instead give everything to the specific sensations that make up the breath, or a mantra, or an image, and cultivate attention to those and the positive mental qualities that arise in strong concentration. Thus, even for pure concentration practice, the specifics of what you are concentrating on matter. ([Location 3099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3099))
- However, when it comes to insight practice, fixation on content must be suspended during that practice session. In insight practice, everything a practitioner has learned about being lost in the names of things and thoughts about them, i.e. content, will be not only completely useless, but an obstacle preventing realization. Here the inquiry must turn to the six sense doors and to impermanence, dissatisfactoriness, and no-self. These characteristics must be realized clearly and directly in whatever sensations arise, be they pleasant, painful, beautiful, ugly, helpful, unhelpful, skillful, unskillful, holy, profane, dull, or otherwise. Anything other than this is just not insight practice, never was, and never will be. ([Location 3104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3104))
- It doesn't matter what the quality of your mind is, or what the sensations of your body are; if you directly understand the momentary sensations that make these up to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not a self or the property of any self, then you are on the right path, the path of liberating insight. ([Location 3109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3109))
- The tradition I come from generally considers what they call the second stage of enlightenment (“second path”, see Part Five p. 330) to be the minimum level of attainment required to be qualified to teach others. This is a very reasonable standard. ([Location 3120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3120))
- It can help to consider that to completely understand compassion is to understand suffering and vice versa, as these are really two sides of the same coin. Also, to understand true-self practices to their end is the same as understanding no-self practices, as these are also two sides of the same coin. ([Location 3142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3142))
- Lama Yeshe's Introduction to Tantra. ([Location 3150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3150))
- One of the clear marks of whether insight practices are appropriate for a given individual is simply that person's ability to do them after having properly understood the instructions on how to do them. If, despite clear instructions and appropriate support, a would-be insight meditator is simply unable to do anything but mentally spin in content, “processing”, and fixation, they should dedicate themselves to carefully cultivating ethical conduct through at least observance of the five precepts until they can hear, understand, and then follow the extremely basic yet precise instructions of insight practices. The Buddha iterated and reiterated that the first training of morality forms the foundation for the latter two trainings.

- Why are you doing all of this? This is a very important question. ([Location 3188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3188))
- In fact, if you understood your actual reality right now clearly enough to get to the root of why you are doing all of this and where all this mental movement comes from, you would be highly realized. ([Location 3195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3195))
- I do not write this lightly. It is vital that your motivation be as clearly understood as possible and that all its energy be channeled into realizing your goals. Wishy-washy practice brings wishy-washy results, and determined, well-guided, brave, and wholehearted practice can eventually bring the desired results. ([Location 3197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3197))

- Whatever ultimate truth you want on the spiritual path is to be found in the sensations of the wanting itself. ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3203))
- Thus, don't look out there except to find wise guidance about how to look in here, for what you are looking for is “nearer than near”. It is in the looking. It is in the motivation. It is in the suffering, which is why this was the first noble truth that the Buddha taught. ([Location 3204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3204))
- The experience of the sensations of the question contains the answer to the content of the question. It is in the love that drives our every wish for happiness. ([Location 3206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3206))
- Awakening arises only when the level of basic sensate clarity is developed enough, which usually takes lots of work, and the heart accepting enough of things as they are. We might say that grace favors the well-trained mind. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3229))
- the very sense of a drive to find something is the thing it is seeking. The motivation is looking for itself. In those sensations is something very powerful and amazing if they are clearly comprehended. However, to see this, a shift must happen in which the drive becomes driven to understand the sensations of that drive itself rather than looking to future sensations for satisfaction and understanding. As straightforward as that sounds, it is a completely unintuitive thing to do, and this is one reason that meditation practices can seem so awkward at times. ([Location 3233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3233))
- If we can get this drive to just chill on its past and future fixation, insight is close at hand. ([Location 3238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3238))
- Thus, if you feel frustrated that your practice has not been as energized or as clear as you wish it to be, first sit with the sensations of the urgency of that wish, with the fullness of that frustration, with the fullness of your fears, your hopes, with the fullness of that suffering and compassion, as clearly and bravely as you possibly can until you understand them to their very depths as they are. Channel all this energy into clear, precise, kind, and focused living and practice. ([Location 3241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3241))
- Goals tend to involve a heavy future component. That future component, poorly related to, can fry insight practitioners. The trick is to add a component that relates to the here and now as well. ([Location 3246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3246))

- We could simply wish to understand deeply the true nature of the sensations that make up our world as they naturally arise and vanish in that practice session or throughout that day. This is a very immediate and present-oriented goal, and a very fine one indeed. It is also method-oriented rather than result-oriented. This is the mark of a good goal. ([Location 3250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3250))

- Similarly, we could try to be kind, honest, or generous that hour or that day, try to appreciate interdependence that day, or try to stay very concentrated on some object for that practice session. ([Location 3252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3252))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- These present and method-oriented goals are the foundation upon which great practice is based. Purely future-oriented goals are at best mostly worthless and at worst very dangerous. ([Location 3253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3253))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Thoughts of the past and future occur only in the present, which is natural and straightforward. These sensations are worthy of investigation. “Future mind” is only a problem if the sensations that make it up are not understood as they are. A fun practice to try is to think consciously those thoughts whose content is purely past- or future-oriented. Notice that they are occurring now and are part of this sense-field, this space here and now. There is something profound about this sort of practice that might be missed on first inspection, and doing this well enough can deconstruct how the sense of time is created, which is liberating in and of itself. ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3261))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is also worth keeping in the front of your mind the three characteristics, the most profound and important of which is no-self, meaning that all phenomena occur interdependently, causally, naturally, and lawfully. By remembering this essential characteristic and keeping it in our minds, we can notice that reality already shows up with comprehension built right into sensations. Sit quietly and notice this most fundamental and liberating aspect of things again and again, realizing that just sitting involves sensations, and each of these sensations is naturally revealing its true nature. Return to this paragraph when you feel you are frying yourself and read it a bunch of times to help it sink in as, strangely, this very easy and natural message can be a hard one to really integrate.

- Thus, my advice when on an insight meditation retreat is to power the investigation skillfully all day long, whether you are sitting, walking, reclining, standing, eating, washing, etc., until you get stable enough to realize that reality is happening on its own and just gently be with that. Take care of your body, particularly your knees and back. ([Location 3318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3318))
- While some students of Buddhism can fixate on the loathsomeness of the body, it is the vehicle we ride to awakening, so care for it appropriately. As spending years working in emergency departments has taught me, by showing me both what people who live long, happy lives do, and also what happens when people do otherwise, your best hope for good physical outcomes results from putting good, nourishing things in your mouth in moderate quantities, avoiding putting bad things in your mouth, exercising in non-damaging ways, driving safely, getting enough sleep, reducing stress, having a good attitude about life, having meaningful things to do with your time, and having good social support. ([Location 3321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3321))
- I heard someone speculating that Zen might have developed as being very austere, strict, and drab because of how colorful and unstable Japan was during its development, and likewise the Tibetan tradition was very colorful and complex because much of the landscape of Tibet was so alienating and bleak. Burmese Buddhism might be so extremely technical, goal-oriented, straightforward, empowering, and efficient because their country is such a chaotic mess politically. Perhaps in just this way, those of us in Europe and North America have some of the most goal-oriented, workaholic cultures in the world and yet tend towards the least goal-oriented, least practical, and least effective take on Buddhism I have found anywhere. ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3335))
- On the other hand, I have found that goal-oriented practice combined with good instruction and a few good conceptual frameworks is largely unstoppable barring extreme circumstances. ([Location 3346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3346))

- Basically, until we are awakened, some odd mixture of compassion and confusion motivates everything we do, as mentioned already, and so we must learn to work with this. Further, these potentially useful emotional energies will continue to arise like the weather, even in awakened beings (contrary to popular belief), so we must learn how to deal with them and use them well. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3364))

- consider reading A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, translated and explained by Bhikkhu Bodhi, which also contains many other useful bits of information woven in with a bit of archaic physiology that can be ignored. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3373))
- The Abhidhamma also outlines very clearly how to investigate and identify the triggers for the emotions. ([Location 3375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3375))
- Those who are passionate about practice and learning to practice correctly are much more likely to make progress than those who are not. ([Location 3393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3393))
- Those who can channel rage, frustration, lust, greed, despair, confusion, and anguish into trying to find a better way are more likely to have what it takes to finally attain freedom. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3394))
- Those who can sit with the specific sensations that make up rage, lust, anger, confusion, and all the rest with clarity, precision, acceptance of their humanity, and equanimity are even more likely to get enlightened. ([Location 3395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3395))
- It is common for people to feel badly about their lack of perceived progress. This can cause extreme frustration, self-judgment, self-hatred, jealousy, depression, extremes of blind faith, and rigid adherence to dogma. It can paralyze their practice if they get caught up in these or in thinking that desire for awakening is a problem when in fact it is the most compassionate wish that someone could have for themselves and others. The whole trick is to channel this energy into actual practice using good technique rather than into thoughts of progress or comparison. ([Location 3397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3397))
- Simply allow yourself to examine the sensations that make up this frustration, self-condemnation, depression, and jealousy, etc. In other words, don't stop investigating when certain categories of sensations arise. Instead, rejoice in each “negative” feeling that you clearly identify in your sensate experience, not because it is a “negative” feeling, but because you had an honest moment of clarity about what was going on. Then, do something skillful with that feeling. ([Location 3401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3401))

- Desire is rooted in the wish to be happy. ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3417))
- Judgment comes from the wish for things to conform to high standards. ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3417))
- Remember that this same quality of compassion is in all beings, in all their unskillful and confused attempts both to find happiness and to put an end to their suffering. ([Location 3421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3421))
- Examine realistically if this will fundamentally help yourself and others and if these changes are within your power to bring about. If so, then plan and act with as much compassion and kindness as possible. ([Location 3424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3424))
- Remember that all the rest of the suffering of that emotional pattern is created by your mind and its confusion, and vow to channel its force into developing morality, concentration, and wisdom. ([Location 3425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3425))

- If we are going to take on feelings at a more formal vipassana level, we might try identifying a feeling we wish to clarify and get to know more skillfully. We can then acknowledge the transient sensations that make up the image of the object of the feeling and notice the oscillation between the sensations that make up our mental image of that object and the tenderhearted center of the feeling. ([Location 3433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3433))
- We often imagine that if we acknowledge our own tenderhearted center we will somehow jinx ourselves to become more susceptible to emotional injury. However, the opposite is true, as that sort of investigation can help reveal a more healthy and clear relationship to our feeling life.

- Remember, there is love and wisdom mixed into even our “worst” emotions. If that is what we have to work with, let's use it wisely. ([Location 3451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3451))
- Luckily, awakening is possible, and the only tool we have is practice based upon necessarily semi-deluded motivations. I am extremely grateful that this seems to be enough if we are willing to use what we do have rather than fantasizing about some idealized us that does not exist.

- Without greed, rage, grandiosity, vanity, frustration, jealousy, arrogance, competitiveness, insecurity, fear, and a host of other delusions, we would hardly budge. We wouldn't pick up dharma books, we wouldn't go on retreats, we wouldn't deal with our stuff, and we wouldn't care at all. But we do care, and so we forge on.

## New highlights added August 17, 2022 at 10:07 AM
- The Path of Purification and The Path of Freedom, ([Location 3650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3650))
- At least in theory, concentration practices are meditations on a concept or a seemingly continuous aggregate of many transient sensations, whereas insight practice is meditation on the transient sensations as they are. ([Location 3682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3682))
- When doing concentration practices, we consciously focus our attention in a specific concentration state. While reality cannot be frozen in this way, the illusion of solidity, continuity, and stability certainly can be cultivated to still attention. This is concentration practice. ([Location 3683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3683))
- All the concentration states strengthen, stabilize, steady, and calm the mind, and this has four primary benefits. ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3718))
- First, just as a video camera that is shaking wildly cannot produce a clearly visible video, so a mind that can't remain settled on an object will not clearly perceive its ultimate truth. ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3718))
- Second, as concentration states cultivate deep clarity and stability on content, albeit very refined content, they are very useful for promoting deep healing and psychological insights. In other words, if you want to become aware of your stuff, do concentration practices, particularly with a focus on mental objects such as mantras rather than physical ones such as the breath, not that breath-based meditations can't also bring up our psychological issues. ([Location 3720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3720))
- Third, concentration states can be a welcome and valid vacation from stress, providing periods of profound relaxation and peace that can be an extremely important part of a sane, compassionate, and healthy lifestyle. Concentration states temporarily suppress the hindrances, all of which are stressful. Temporarily suppressing the hindrances in this way is considered extremely skillful. The Buddha highly praised those who had mastery of the concentration states, and this should serve as a reminder to those who dismiss or underestimate their great value or mistakenly feel that enjoying our life is somehow “unspiritual”. ([Location 3723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3723))
- Fourth, concentration practices can help insight practitioners maintain powerful mental stability as old habitual concepts about themselves and all existence are dismantled and razed by insight practice. However, if these concentration states end up blocking our ability to gain insight, by solidifying a sense of self, or creating aversion to experience suffering clearly, then they can become a significant and dangerously lofty kind of hindrance. Pleasurable hindrances that come from spiritual practice are traditionally referred to as “golden chains”. ([Location 3728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3728))
- Bhante Gunaratana's A Critical Analysis of the Jhanas, included in his more complete work The Path of Serenity and Insight, ([Location 3932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3932))
- Nyanatiloka's The Buddha's Path to Deliverance. ([Location 3933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3933))
- On the hardcore end, check out the work of Ajahn Brahm and Pa Auk Sayadaw. ([Location 3935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3935))
- you are not up for often lengthy and occasionally laborious reading, start with Path to Deliverance and Path of Freedom. ([Location 3941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3941))
- Bhante Gunaratana's The Path of Serenity and Insight, and Buddhaghosa's Path of Purification chapters four and five (extremely useful and highly recommended) provide such a good treatment that you should obtain and read those sources if you want to familiarize yourself with ([Location 3970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=3970))
- Notice that if we are spinning lost in thought, decent concentration is basically impossible. If you wish to attain this, I would try to stay as completely as possible with a chosen meditation object for perhaps one minute. When you can do this, try for ten minutes. When you can do this, try for an hour. For instance, if you were using the breath as an object, try to be aware of every single breath at least in part for a full ten minutes, and then for an hour. This is possible, and a reasonable goal. ([Location 4001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4001))
- Try not to pay too much attention to the individual sensations themselves, but conceptualize the breath as a coherent and continuous entity, with many different types of sensations all being thought of as being the breath. It is important to know that really getting into a sense of the breath as a continuous entity for ten seconds will do you more good than being with the breath on and off for an hour. ([Location 4004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4004))
- Tune in to the illusory smoothness of things by purposefully and calmly working with illusions of solidity or fluidity. There is a certain “into it” quality which helps, sort of like really getting into a slow groove when playing an instrument, having sex, playing a sport, or just sinking into a well-deserved warm bubble bath. That, “Oh, yeah, baby, just like that!” vibe is exactly what you are looking for, at least initially. When doing concentration… ([Location 4007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4007))
- Merely concentrating is not necessarily sufficient to get us into jhana, though it helps and may cause it to arise naturally; but for some it takes inclination in the direction of jhana, intending to go that way, so knowing the general qualities you are looking for helps with that inclination. Sensations that feel good naturally reinforce concentration, so use that feedback loop of feeling good leading to paying more attention, which leads to better concentration, which leads to feeling even better, which leads to paying even more attention. Being in a silent and safe place is also very conducive, as is giving yourself permission to relax, put the cares of the world behind you, and enjoy. Concentration practice benefits greatly from optimal conditions. That said, some of us, like myself, are more aversive types, and pleasure, while fun enough, doesn't hold my attention as well as it does for some others. I personally find that secluding the mind from disturbing or unpleasant sensations by tuning attention away from them and towards stillness and stability of attention can sometimes be a good strategy for working with my more aversive nature, as that turning away from everything that is not jhana is also a way into jhana. You will have to see what works best for you and your personality makeup.3 Comfort in posture is important also, as pain makes getting into these states more difficult. A strongly concentrated mind can overcome and eventually entirely block out pain. While it is possible to get into blissful and peaceful states while in painful physical positions, I don't see the point in doing… ([Location 4011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4011))
- Back to the instructions: if you are using the breath as your primary meditation object, you might try purposefully visualizing it as sweet, smooth waves or circles that are peaceful and welcome. Try breathing as if you were in a garden of fragrant roses and you wish to experience the fullness of their fragrance. ([Location 4047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4047))
- Some degree of stagnation is guaranteed in insight practice if you cling in this way to pleasant sensations, or anything else for that matter. In other words, if you fail to truly perceive the impermanence of all phenomena that make up your subjective experience, you will have artificially solidified them (“clung to” them in the standard yet not-very-precise parlance) and you will not gain clear insight into the way they occur. ([Location 4111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4111))
- Taking the breadth of attention itself as object is one of my favorite ways to get into this jhana. ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079LW4J8K&location=4201))
