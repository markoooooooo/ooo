- THERE WAS A CERTAIN SADHAKA who frequented forest glades where he thought there were no other people.

About an hour later, sounds and light spontaneously arose from the pills. When the acarya put them into his mouth he was able to see the realms of the gods and yaksha, and he also found that he could travel to those places in a flash if he wished to.

- Over a decade before his work on soma, R. Gordon Wasson published a paper on the worldwide belief that mushrooms are engendered by thunderstorms.30 That being the case, Indra, as wielder of thunderbolts (i.e. lightning) was the god who caused mushrooms to sprout. Specifically, it was believed in India that the sound of the thunder caused mushrooms to appear.c In fact, it has recently been discovered that electrical discharges, such as lightning, while they may not actually cause mushrooms to appear, do significantly increase yields in commercial mushroom farming.31 ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07T16C2YT&location=1004))
