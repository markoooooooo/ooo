## Highlights
- Appreciation for Light along the Way: Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Parcifal, Malaclypse the Younger, The New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, Dr. Israel Regardie ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=39))
- The reason why its flame still burns is that it is also a book for the ages. It is a story about becoming lost. It is about entering that psychological space where all your maps have run out, and the world refuses to make sense regardless of how you look at it. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=159))
- Wilson’s account of his time in the Wilderness, ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=164))
- personal mythology. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=178))
- November 2014 Cosmic Trigger play and accompanying ‘Find The Others’ festival, ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=184))
- Yet it has become a glue which connects the personal mythologies of a wide network of people, all of whom add to a greater story which we only catch glimpses of. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=190))
- If you apply meaning to a thing you have made, then you have art. If you apply meaning to a person, then you have love. If you apply meaning to the universe, then you have God. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=194))
- There is an inexhaustible supply of meaning. So what’s the fucking problem? The problem is, of course, that meaning is not fixed. It ebbs and flows like the tide. Sometimes you are drenched in the stuff, and life is self-evidently worthwhile and full of purpose and humour. And at others, it all drains away, and you are left with the horrors. In Cosmic Trigger, Robert Anton Wilson shows us how to navigate these waters, both when life is too meaningful and when all meaning is gone. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=199))
- “humans live through their myths, and only endure their realities.” ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=208))
- Wilson’s refusal to insist that his reality tunnel has more validity than that of his readers is, I think, the great gift of this book. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=209))
- It should be obvious to all intelligent readers (but curiously is not obvious to many) that my viewpoint in this book is one of agnosticism. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=226))
- I DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=230))
- My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=236))
- As soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops thinking about that aspect of existence. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=237))
- The more certitude one assumes, the less there is left to think about, and a person sure of everything would never have any need to think about anything and might be considered clinically dead under current medical standards, where the absence of brain activity is taken to mean that life has ended. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=238))
- The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called "model agnosticism" and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=242))
- Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist, tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan, "The map is not the territory." ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=244))
- Alan Watts, a talented exegete of Oriental philosophy, restated it more vividly as "The menu is not the meal." ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=244))
- Briefly, the main thing I learned in my experiments is that "reality" is always plural and mutable. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=256))
- "Reality" is a word in the English language which happens to be (a) a noun and (b) singular. Thinking in the English language (and in cognate Indo-European languages) therefore subliminally programs us to conceptualize "reality" as one block-like entity, sort of like a huge New York skyscraper, in which every part is just another "room" within the same building. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=260))
- This linguistic program is so pervasive that most people cannot "think" outside it at all, and when one tries to offer a different perspective they imagine one is talking gibberish. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=263))
- The notion that "reality" is a noun, a solid thing like a brick or a baseball bat, derives from the evolutionary fact that our nervous systems normally organize the dance of energy into such block-like "things," probably as instant bio-survival cues. Such "things," however, dissolve back into energy dances — processes, or verbs — when the nervous system is synergized with certain drugs or transmuted by yogic or shamanic exercises or aided by scientific instruments. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=265))
- In both mysticism and physics, there is general agreement that "things" are constructed by our nervous systems and that "realities" (plural) are better described as systems or bundles of energy-functions. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=269))
- The notion that "reality" is singular, like a hermetically sealed jar, does not jibe with scientific findings which, in this century, suggest that "reality" may better be considered as flowing and meandering, like a river, or interacting, like a dance, or evolving, like life itself. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=272))
- Most philosophers have known, at least since around 500 B.C., that the world perceived by our senses is not "the real world" but a construct we create — our own private work of art. Modern science began with Galileo's demonstration that color is not "in" objects but "in" the inter-action of our senses with objects. Despite this philosophic and scientific knowledge of neurological relativity, which has been more clearly demonstrated with each major advance in instrumentation, we still, due to language, think that behind the flowing, meandering, inter-acting, evolving universe created by perception is one solid monolithic "reality" hard and crisply outlined as an iron bar. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=275))
- The only "realities" (plural) that we actually experience and can talk meaningfully about are perceived realities, experienced realities, existential realities — realities involving ourselves as editors — and they are all relative to the observer, fluctuating, evolving, capable of being magnified and enriched, moving from low resolution to hi-fi, and do not fit together like the pieces of a jig-saw into one single Reality with a capital R. Rather, they cast illumination upon one another by contrast, like the paintings in a large museum, or the different symphonic styles of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Mahler. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=285))
- Alan Watts may have said it best of all: "The universe is a giant Rorschach ink-blot." Science finds one meaning in it in the 18th Century, another in the 19th, a third in the 20th; each artist finds unique meanings on other levels of abstraction; and each man and woman finds different meanings at different hours of the day, depending on the internal and external environments. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=290))
- What my experiments demonstrate — what all such experiments throughout history have demonstrated — is simply that our models of "reality" are very small and tidy, the universe of experience is huge and untidy, and no model can ever include all the huge untidiness perceived by uncensored consciousness. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=304))
- I think, or hope, that my data also demonstrates that neurological model agnosticism — the application of the Copenhagen Interpretation beyond physics to consciousness itself — allows one to escape from certain limits of mechanical emotion and robot mentation that are inescapable as long as one remains within one dogmatic model or one imprinted reality-tunnel. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=307))
- VALIS by Philip K. Dick and The Sirian Experiments by Doris Lessing. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=325))
- (See Philip K. Dick: The Last Testament, by Gregg Rickman.) ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=329))
- I heartily recommend all three volumes — VALIS, The Last Testament and The Sirian Experiments — to readers of this book. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=337))
- an optimistic mind-set finds dozens of possible solutions for every problem that the pessimist regards as incurable. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=350))
- Since we all create our habitual reality-tunnels, either consciously and intelligently or unconsciously and mechanically, I prefer to create for each hour the happiest, funniest and most romantic reality-tunnel consistent with the signals my brain apprehends. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=352))
- This book does not claim that "you create your own reality" in the sense of total (but mysteriously unconscious) psychokinesis. If a car hits you and puts you in the hospital, I do not believe this is because you "really wanted" to be hit by a car, or that you "needed" to be hit by a car, as two popular New Age bromides have it. The theory of transactional psychology, which is the source of my favorite models and metaphors, merely says that, once you have been hit by a car, the meaning of the experience depends entirely on you and the results depend partly on you (and partly on your doctors). ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=356))
- you ultimately decide whether to get out of the hospital in a hurry or to lie around suffering and complaining. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=362))
- When I write of creating a better and more optimistic reality-tunnel, of transcending ego games, and of similar matters, it is not because I have lived in an ivory tower. It is because I have learned a few practical techniques for dealing with the brutal conditions on this primitive planet. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=368))
- when dogma enters the brain, all intellectual activity ceases. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=385))
- It has been axiomatic since Haeckel that ontology recapitulates phylogeny ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=396))
- that the individual in Hir* development repeats, step-by-step, the evolution of the species. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=397))
- Consider Lao-tse. In the 6th Century B.C., SHe realizes Einsteinian relativity, senses that all is flow and evolutionary change; anticipates (in the I Ching) what computer designers will understand 2,500 years later — that energy comes in the binary code of yin-yang (off-on); forecasts (in the Ching trigrams) what micro-geneticists will discover 2,500 years later — the triplicate function of amino-acid binding. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=408))
- Now consider the Buddha. Also in the 6th Century B.C., SHe realizes that consciousness creates reality; that all is maya, i.e. an internal dance of neurons, an external dance of protons. SHe advises detachment from tribal imprints (local reality-tunnels), announces the octave nature of evolution (again knowing it will be corrupted by moralists into the 8-fold path of domesticated virtue and marketed eventually as the 8 x 8 chessboard). SHe knows that Mendeleyev and the octave division of quarks await 100 generations in the future. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=424))
- Beelzebub’s Tales to His Grandson, ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=438))
- Dante, Boccaccio, James Joyce, Hesse. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=460))
- For example, Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, the Illuminatus trilogy of Wilson and Shea, and the book you hold in your hand. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=462))
- lives by his wits and wisdom. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=480))
- Summer, 1977 ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=485))
- The Firesign Theatre ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=489))
- Chapel Perilous, like the mysterious entity called “I,” cannot be located in the space-time continuum; it is weightless, odorless, tasteless and undetectable by ordinary instruments. Indeed, like the Ego, it is even possible to deny that it is there. And yet, even more like the Ego, once you are inside it, there doesn’t seem to be any way to ever get out again, until you suddenly discover that it has been brought into existence by thought and does not exist outside thought. Every thing you fear is waiting with slavering jaws in Chapel Perilous, but if you are armed with the wand of intuition, the cup of sympathy, the sword of reason and the pentacle of valor, you will find there (the legends say) the Medicine of Metals, the Elixir of Life, the Philosopher’s Stone, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=554))
- Even more remarkably, if you approach without the wand of intuition, you can stand at the door for decades never realizing you have arrived. You might think you are just waiting for a bus, or wandering from room to room looking for your cigarettes, watching a TV show, or reading a cryptic and ambiguous book. Chapel Perilous is tricky that way. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=562))
- The Book of Lies by the English mystic Aleister Crowley.2 ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=566))
- occult historian Francis King ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=576))
- Suddenly, in a “blinding flash” or at least a mini-Satori, I knew Crowley’s secret. It was in Chapter 69 and deals with Tantric Sex. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=584))
- The outstanding result was that I entered a belief system, from July 1973 until around October 1974, in which I was receiving telepathic messages from entities residing on a planet of the double star Sirius. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=591))
- As Neal Wilgus notes in The Illuminoids, ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=596))
- From the beginning The Illuminoids was shaped by coincidence, from the discovery of Daraul’s Secret Societies to the publication of Shea and Wilson’s Illuminatus . . . A book by another Wilson — Colin Wilson’s The Occult — was also discovered at just the right moment and often “fell open at the right page” just as Wilson says other references did for him.4 ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=597))
## New highlights added November 23, 2022 at 4:56 PM
- hilarious theological-psychedelic novel called Jumped by Jesus. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=634))
- I quickly obtained a copy of Temple’s book from England, and was staggered by it.5 ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=636))
- First there is a mountain, Then there is no mountain, Then there is. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=647))
- A monk who had meditated long in search of Illumination finally received a great flash of insight. Rushing to his roshi (Zen Master), the monk cried out, “I have it! I have it! That rock there is inside my head.” “You must have a big head,” the Master replied, “to hold a rock that size.” ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=788))
- psychedelics (a word coined by Humphrey Osmond, M.D.) ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=810))
- metaprogramming substances (coined by John Lilly, M.D.); that is, the new state is considered one in which we can reorganize or re-imprint our nervous system for higher functioning. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=811))
- founded the Native American Church, used to say, “The white man goes into his church and talks to Jesus. The Indian goes into his tipi, takes peyote, and talks with Jesus.”) ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=871))
- particular critter. Five years later, in 1968, the Skeptic read Carlos Castaneda’s The Teachings of Don Juan, ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=886))
- He was the spirit of the peyote plant.10 But the Materialist had seen him before he ever read a description of him. That was most perplexing to the Materialist. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=889))
- A fairly plausible explanation is that Mescalito is an archetype of the collective unconscious, in the Jungian sense. He has been reported by many others besides Castaneda and me, and he always has the same green warty skin and is often dancing.11 ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=892))
- Paracelsus, the founder of modern medicine, believed in such spirits and claimed frequent commerce with them. So did the German poet Goethe and the pioneer of organic agriculture, Rudolph Steiner — and the ideas of Goethe and Steiner, once rejected as too mystical, are currently being seriously reconsidered by many ecologists.12 ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=896))
- Fechner lost his sight and then regained it, after which he asserted that with his new vision he saw many things normal people do not see — including auras around humans and other living creatures, and vegetation spirits just like Mescalito. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=900))
- George Washington Carver also claimed a link with spirits in the vegetation, and so did the great Luther Burbank. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=902))
- Thomas Edison became so convinced of their literal existence that he spent many years trying to develop a photographic process that would render them visible.13 ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=903))
- This shamanic kind of selective attention, or special perception, has been duplicated in the modern world by Dr. Vogel, who has given many demonstrations before audiences, in which he accurately reads vegetative signals from plants. It is no more spooky than the selective yogic trance of the average city-dweller, which allows him to walk in mindless indifference through incredible noise, filth, pandemonium, misery, neurosis, violence, psychosis, rape, burglary, injustice and exploitation, screening it all out and concentrating only on robot-repetition of his assigned role in the hive-economy. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=916))
- One can train oneself to receive or ignore a far wider variety of signals than the neurologically untrained realize. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=920))
- Clarke’s Law (by science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke): “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magick. ” ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=924))
- If Clarke is right even on a materialistic level, the only answer to “How many Advanced Civilizations are monitoring the events in this room?” must be “As many as want to.” ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=932))
- We see the sun “going down” at twilight, but science assures us that nothing of the sort is happening; instead, the earth is turning. We perceive an orange as really orange whereas it is actually blue, the orange light being the light bouncing off the real fruit. And, everywhere we look, we imagine solid objects, but science finds only a web of dancing energy. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=967))
- The great and venerable Sufi sage, Mullah Nasrudin, once raced through Bagdad on his donkey, galloping as fast as the poor beast could travel. Everybody got excited and people rushed into the streets to find out why the philosopher was in such a great hurry. “What are you looking for, Mullah?” somebody shouted. “I’m looking for my donkey!” Nasrudin answered. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=971))
- the Cosmic Secret. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=977))
- We look for the Secret — the Philosopher’s Stone, the Elixir of the Wise, Supreme Enlightenment, “God,” or whatever the final answer might be — in all directions, north, east, south, and west, and all the time it is carrying us about. It is the human nervous system itself, the marvelous instrument through which we create order out of chaos, science out of ignorance, meaning out of mystery, “Mescalito” (or a chair) out of whirling energy. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=978))
- Dogen Zenji, an 18th century Zen master, used to ask trainees, “Who is the Master who makes the grass green?” Again, the answer is as close as our visual cortex. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=981))
- That our own experience of reality might be equally self-created — that, as Nietzsche said, “We are all greater artists than we realize” — is hard to believe, and even harder to remember moment-by-moment, even after we have had enough experience to believe it. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=998))
- Kerry Thornley ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1014))
- The Net, according to Jano, is a web of coincidence (or synchronicity) which connects everything-in-the-universe with everything-else-in-the-universe. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1027))
- Many other scientists have agreed with Carl Jung’s opinion that the number of startling coincidences in “the Net” increases sharply around anybody who becomes involved in depth psychology or in any investigation that extends the perimeter of consciousness. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1031))
- Arthur Koestler has written about this at length, in both The Roots of Coincidence and The Challenge of Chance.15 ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1033))
- Dr. John Lilly has whimsically suggested that consciousness research activates the agents of “Cosmic Coincidence Control Center.” Let us hope he is joking. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1035))
- (everybody knows the PT-109 story) and ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1041))
- Worse yet, most have no knowledge at all about the difference in degree between a merely legal proof, a logical or verbal proof, a proof in the soft sciences like psychology, and a proof in the hard physical-mathematical sciences. They are full of opinions, but they have little ability to distinguish the relative degree of proof upholding all these various opinions. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1051))
- We say “seeing is believing,” but actually, as Santayana pointed out, we are all much better at believing than at seeing. In fact, we are seeing what we believe nearly all the time and only occasionally seeing what we can’t believe. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1055))
- “The best results come when you fuck someone you really love, during the acid trip,” he said that day. “That’s when the nervous system is most open, most unconditioned, and ready to take a completely new imprint.” ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1088))
- that the psychedelic drug experience is a synergetic product of three non-additive factors: (1) the dosage of the chemical used; (2) the set — the subject’s expectations, emotional status games, personality profile, etc.; and (3) the setting — the actual events in space-time.

- He had thrown out the concepts of “psychologist” and “patient” back in ’57, replacing them with “research team,” because he was convinced that the hierarchy implied in “psychologist” (top dog) and “patient” (bottom dog) predetermined certain conclusions. Now he wanted to examine all interpersonal relations in terms of the Morgenstern-von Neumann game model. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1113))

- Leary went on to reject virtually all psychological terminology as pre-scientific and vague. “We’ve got a contract among ourselves,” he said, “that we’re going to talk sense, and that means specifying where the bodies are in space-time and what sort of signals they’re exchanging.” ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1129))
- Nobody was “sane” or “insane,” “right” or “wrong,” “hallucinating” or “not-hallucinating”; all those words were value-judgments, relative to the observer’s prejudices. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1133))

- He had developed a seven-dimensional game model and insisted on analyzing all behavior in terms of the (1) roles being played (2) rules tacitly accepted by all players; (3) strategies for winning (or for masochistic winning-by-losing); (4) goals of the game, purpose served; (5) language of the game, and the semantic world-view implied; (6) characteristic space-time locations, and (7) characteristic movements in space-time.

- It became clear as vodka that whatever “reality” means philosophically, our everyday experience (the common-sense definition of “reality”) is almost entirely self-programmed. This cinematic editing occurs so rapidly that we are normally not aware of doing it, thus we add many things that aren’t there at all (Freud’s projection) and leave out millions of things that are there (Freud’s censorship). Confusing the finished product with an accurate reflection of externality is exactly what Buddha meant when he said normal consciousness is delusion (maya).

- Out of the hundred million buzzing, bright, busy signals received every minute, the human brain ignores most and organizes the rest in conformity with whatever belief system it currently holds. One can select lawful-and-orderly signals and claim that all is projected by a Cosmic Intelligence as in Thomism, or select chaotic signals and claim God is a Crazy Woman as in Discordianism. The Brain will adjust incoming signals to either belief system . . . or to dozens of others. ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=1571))
- This illustrates that one way to double your practical intelligence (awareness of detail) is to try to receive as many signals as possible from other humans, however wrong-headed their reality-map may seem, however dumb or boring they might sound at first. Our usual habit of screening out all human signals not immediately compatible with our own favorite reality-map is the mechanism which keeps us all far stupider than we should be.

- From that time to this the Skeptic has made it a point to read one or two periodicals every month put out by some political or religious group he despises, just to see what sort of signals are being screened out by his habitual reality-maps.

- The only reason most people remain in the same jobs, the same towns, the same belief-systems, year after year, decade after decade, is, of course, that cultural conditioning, in every tribe, is a process of gradually narrowing your tunnel-reality.
