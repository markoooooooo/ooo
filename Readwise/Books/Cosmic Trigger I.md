- The reason why its flame still burns is that it is also a book for the ages. It is a story about becoming lost. It is about entering that psychological space where all your maps have run out, and the world refuses to make sense regardless of how you look at it. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=159))
- Wilson’s account of his time in the Wilderness, ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=164))
- personal mythology. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=178))
- November 2014 Cosmic Trigger play and accompanying ‘Find The Others’ festival, ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=184))
- Yet it has become a glue which connects the personal mythologies of a wide network of people, all of whom add to a greater story which we only catch glimpses of. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=190))
- If you apply meaning to a thing you have made, then you have art. If you apply meaning to a person, then you have love. If you apply meaning to the universe, then you have God. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=194))
- There is an inexhaustible supply of meaning. So what’s the fucking problem? The problem is, of course, that meaning is not fixed. It ebbs and flows like the tide. Sometimes you are drenched in the stuff, and life is self-evidently worthwhile and full of purpose and humour. And at others, it all drains away, and you are left with the horrors. In Cosmic Trigger, Robert Anton Wilson shows us how to navigate these waters, both when life is too meaningful and when all meaning is gone. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=199))
- “humans live through their myths, and only endure their realities.” ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=208))
- Wilson’s refusal to insist that his reality tunnel has more validity than that of his readers is, I think, the great gift of this book. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=209))
- It should be obvious to all intelligent readers (but curiously is not obvious to many) that my viewpoint in this book is one of agnosticism. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=226))
- I DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=230))
- My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=236))
- As soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops thinking about that aspect of existence. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=237))
- The more certitude one assumes, the less there is left to think about, and a person sure of everything would never have any need to think about anything and might be considered clinically dead under current medical standards, where the absence of brain activity is taken to mean that life has ended. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=238))
- The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called "model agnosticism" and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=242))
- Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist, tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan, "The map is not the territory." ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=244))
- Alan Watts, a talented exegete of Oriental philosophy, restated it more vividly as "The menu is not the meal." ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=244))
- Briefly, the main thing I learned in my experiments is that "reality" is always plural and mutable. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=256))
- "Reality" is a word in the English language which happens to be (a) a noun and (b) singular. Thinking in the English language (and in cognate Indo-European languages) therefore subliminally programs us to conceptualize "reality" as one block-like entity, sort of like a huge New York skyscraper, in which every part is just another "room" within the same building. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=260))
- This linguistic program is so pervasive that most people cannot "think" outside it at all, and when one tries to offer a different perspective they imagine one is talking gibberish. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=263))
- The notion that "reality" is a noun, a solid thing like a brick or a baseball bat, derives from the evolutionary fact that our nervous systems normally organize the dance of energy into such block-like "things," probably as instant bio-survival cues. Such "things," however, dissolve back into energy dances — processes, or verbs — when the nervous system is synergized with certain drugs or transmuted by yogic or shamanic exercises or aided by scientific instruments. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=265))
- In both mysticism and physics, there is general agreement that "things" are constructed by our nervous systems and that "realities" (plural) are better described as systems or bundles of energy-functions. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=269))
- The notion that "reality" is singular, like a hermetically sealed jar, does not jibe with scientific findings which, in this century, suggest that "reality" may better be considered as flowing and meandering, like a river, or interacting, like a dance, or evolving, like life itself. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=272))
- Most philosophers have known, at least since around 500 B.C., that the world perceived by our senses is not "the real world" but a construct we create — our own private work of art. Modern science began with Galileo's demonstration that color is not "in" objects but "in" the inter-action of our senses with objects. Despite this philosophic and scientific knowledge of neurological relativity, which has been more clearly demonstrated with each major advance in instrumentation, we still, due to language, think that behind the flowing, meandering, inter-acting, evolving universe created by perception is one solid monolithic "reality" hard and crisply outlined as an iron bar. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=275))
- The only "realities" (plural) that we actually experience and can talk meaningfully about are perceived realities, experienced realities, existential realities — realities involving ourselves as editors — and they are all relative to the observer, fluctuating, evolving, capable of being magnified and enriched, moving from low resolution to hi-fi, and do not fit together like the pieces of a jig-saw into one single Reality with a capital R. Rather, they cast illumination upon one another by contrast, like the paintings in a large museum, or the different symphonic styles of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Mahler. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=285))
- Alan Watts may have said it best of all: "The universe is a giant Rorschach ink-blot." Science finds one meaning in it in the 18th Century, another in the 19th, a third in the 20th; each artist finds unique meanings on other levels of abstraction; and each man and woman finds different meanings at different hours of the day, depending on the internal and external environments. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=290))
- What my experiments demonstrate — what all such experiments throughout history have demonstrated — is simply that our models of "reality" are very small and tidy, the universe of experience is huge and untidy, and no model can ever include all the huge untidiness perceived by uncensored consciousness. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=304))
- I think, or hope, that my data also demonstrates that neurological model agnosticism — the application of the Copenhagen Interpretation beyond physics to consciousness itself — allows one to escape from certain limits of mechanical emotion and robot mentation that are inescapable as long as one remains within one dogmatic model or one imprinted reality-tunnel. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=307))
- VALIS by Philip K. Dick and The Sirian Experiments by Doris Lessing. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=325))
- (See Philip K. Dick: The Last Testament, by Gregg Rickman.) ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=329))
- I heartily recommend all three volumes — VALIS, The Last Testament and The Sirian Experiments — to readers of this book. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=337))
- an optimistic mind-set finds dozens of possible solutions for every problem that the pessimist regards as incurable. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=350))
- Since we all create our habitual reality-tunnels, either consciously and intelligently or unconsciously and mechanically, I prefer to create for each hour the happiest, funniest and most romantic reality-tunnel consistent with the signals my brain apprehends. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=352))
- This book does not claim that "you create your own reality" in the sense of total (but mysteriously unconscious) psychokinesis. If a car hits you and puts you in the hospital, I do not believe this is because you "really wanted" to be hit by a car, or that you "needed" to be hit by a car, as two popular New Age bromides have it. The theory of transactional psychology, which is the source of my favorite models and metaphors, merely says that, once you have been hit by a car, the meaning of the experience depends entirely on you and the results depend partly on you (and partly on your doctors). ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=356))
- you ultimately decide whether to get out of the hospital in a hurry or to lie around suffering and complaining. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=362))
- When I write of creating a better and more optimistic reality-tunnel, of transcending ego games, and of similar matters, it is not because I have lived in an ivory tower. It is because I have learned a few practical techniques for dealing with the brutal conditions on this primitive planet. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=368))
- when dogma enters the brain, all intellectual activity ceases. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=385))
- It has been axiomatic since Haeckel that ontology recapitulates phylogeny ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=396))
- that the individual in Hir* development repeats, step-by-step, the evolution of the species. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=397))
- Consider Lao-tse. In the 6th Century B.C., SHe realizes Einsteinian relativity, senses that all is flow and evolutionary change; anticipates (in the I Ching) what computer designers will understand 2,500 years later — that energy comes in the binary code of yin-yang (off-on); forecasts (in the Ching trigrams) what micro-geneticists will discover 2,500 years later — the triplicate function of amino-acid binding. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=408))
- Now consider the Buddha. Also in the 6th Century B.C., SHe realizes that consciousness creates reality; that all is maya, i.e. an internal dance of neurons, an external dance of protons. SHe advises detachment from tribal imprints (local reality-tunnels), announces the octave nature of evolution (again knowing it will be corrupted by moralists into the 8-fold path of domesticated virtue and marketed eventually as the 8 x 8 chessboard). SHe knows that Mendeleyev and the octave division of quarks await 100 generations in the future. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=424))
- Beelzebub’s Tales to His Grandson, ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=438))
- Dante, Boccaccio, James Joyce, Hesse. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=460))
- For example, Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, the Illuminatus trilogy of Wilson and Shea, and the book you hold in your hand. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=462))
- lives by his wits and wisdom. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=480))
- Summer, 1977 ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=485))
- The Firesign Theatre ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=489))
- Chapel Perilous, like the mysterious entity called “I,” cannot be located in the space-time continuum; it is weightless, odorless, tasteless and undetectable by ordinary instruments. Indeed, like the Ego, it is even possible to deny that it is there. And yet, even more like the Ego, once you are inside it, there doesn’t seem to be any way to ever get out again, until you suddenly discover that it has been brought into existence by thought and does not exist outside thought. Every thing you fear is waiting with slavering jaws in Chapel Perilous, but if you are armed with the wand of intuition, the cup of sympathy, the sword of reason and the pentacle of valor, you will find there (the legends say) the Medicine of Metals, the Elixir of Life, the Philosopher’s Stone, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=554))
- Even more remarkably, if you approach without the wand of intuition, you can stand at the door for decades never realizing you have arrived. You might think you are just waiting for a bus, or wandering from room to room looking for your cigarettes, watching a TV show, or reading a cryptic and ambiguous book. Chapel Perilous is tricky that way. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=562))
- The Book of Lies by the English mystic Aleister Crowley.2 ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=566))
- occult historian Francis King ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=576))
- Suddenly, in a “blinding flash” or at least a mini-Satori, I knew Crowley’s secret. It was in Chapter 69 and deals with Tantric Sex. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=584))
- The outstanding result was that I entered a belief system, from July 1973 until around October 1974, in which I was receiving telepathic messages from entities residing on a planet of the double star Sirius. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=591))
- As Neal Wilgus notes in The Illuminoids, ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=596))
- From the beginning The Illuminoids was shaped by coincidence, from the discovery of Daraul’s Secret Societies to the publication of Shea and Wilson’s Illuminatus . . . A book by another Wilson — Colin Wilson’s The Occult — was also discovered at just the right moment and often “fell open at the right page” just as Wilson says other references did for him.4 ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0T1V0W&location=597))
