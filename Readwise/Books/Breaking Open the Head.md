## Highlights
- One must explore deep and believe the incredible to find the new particles of truth floating in an ocean of insignificance.  —JOSEPH CONRAD ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=71))
- One inspiration is Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish thinker who experimented with hashish and mescaline in the 1920s. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=98))
- Benjamin thought that visionary intoxication, achieved through drugs or other means, could be a “profane illumination,” shattering the hypnotic trance of modern life. “The reader, the thinker, the flaneur, are types of illuminati just as much as the opium eater, the dreamer, the ecstatic,” Benjamin wrote. “Not to mention that most terrible drug—ourselves—which we take in solitude.” ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=99))
- The forbidden substances can be a precision technology for revealing the interstitial processes of thinking, the flickering candle sputters of emotion, the fine-tuned machinery of sense perceptions. The unfolding of the self through an increase in perception, cognition, and feeling is one level of the trip. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=110))
- In The Long Trip, a study of visionary drug use through history, Paul Devereux muses: “I sometimes wonder if our culture, acting in the manner of a single organism—in the way a crowd of people or a classroom of students sometimes can—somehow senses a deep threat to its own philosophical foundations residing in the psychedelic experience. This might help account for the otherwise irrational hatred and repression of the use of hallucinogens, and the smirking dismissal of the psychedelic experience as a trivial one by so many of our intellectuals.” ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=121))
- It is the nature of repression to be invisible. Something that is repressed can’t reveal itself to us, can’t appear as a break in our awareness—then we would see its workings, and the repression would be dispelled. In a world of information overload and perpetual distraction, repression manifests as a dismissive giggle, a yawn of boredom, a sin of omission. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=126))
- “Repression is reflexive,” notes the literary critic Frederic Jameson, “that is, it aims not only at removing a particular object from consciousness, but also and above all, at doing away with the trace of that removal as well, at repressing the very memory of the intent to repress.” For over thirty years, a tremendous force of cultural repression has been exerted on the subject of psychedelics. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=129))
- Antidepressants fit our society’s underlying biases. Psychedelics, emphatically, do not. Is it possible that we have demonized hallucinogens because we fear the contents of our own minds? ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=137))
- When he tried mescaline for the first time, the chemist Sasha Shulgin found “the world amazed me, in that I saw it as I had when I was a child. I had forgotten the beauty and the magic and the knowingness of it and me.” He realized the tiny amount of white powder he had ingested could not have caused such profound visions. It had only revealed what was inside of him. He understood that “our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not to find access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there inside us, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability.” ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFMXO&location=138))
