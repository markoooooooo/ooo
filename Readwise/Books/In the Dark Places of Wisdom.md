## Highlights
- We want healing from illness, but it's through illness that we grow and are healed of our complacency. We're afraid of loss, and yet it's through what we lose that we're able to find what nothing can take away from us. We run from sadness and depression. But if we really face our sadness we find it speaks with the voice of our deepest longing; and if we face it a little longer we find that it teaches us the way to attain what we long for.

- This life of the senses can never fulfil us, even though the whole world will tel1 us the oρρosite. It never was meant to fulfil us. The truth is so simρle, so lovingly simple: if we want to grow up, become true men and women, we have to face death before we die.

- The price is wl1at it always has been: ourselves, ouιwillingness to be rι-ansformed. Norhing less will do. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLC5JYV6&location=74))
- For we're not just twenty or forty or seventy years old. That's onlyan appearance. We're ancient, incredibly ancient. We hold the history of the staι-s in our pockets. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLC5JYV6&location=83))
