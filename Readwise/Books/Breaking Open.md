## Highlights
- How do we describe these states of mind? Terminology is always difficult. The psychiatric term psychosis is often associated with medical reductionism, pathology, medication, and stigma. Terms such as spiritual awakening or shamanic initiation may come with their own baggage. Perhaps the best-known term is spiritual emergency (introduced by Stanislav and Christina Grof), which we offer here as a helpful model, suggesting both a serious crisis but also the inherent opportunity for emergence to a higher level of psychological organisation with an enhanced sense of spirituality.
