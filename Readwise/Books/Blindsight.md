## Highlights
- TRY TO TOUCH THE PAST. TRY TO DEAL WITH THE PAST. IT’S NOT REAL. IT’S JUST A DREAM. —Ted Bundy ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=103))
- noosphere ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=466))
- The most altruistic and sustainable philosophies fail before the brute brain stem imperative of self-interest. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=641))
- li’l ol’ me ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=661))
- LEADERS ARE VISIONARIES WITH A POORLY DEVELOPED SENSE OF FEAR AND NO CONCEPT OF THE ODDS AGAINST THEM. —Robert Jarvik ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=1004))
- Technology implies belligerence, ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=1158))
- To the Historians, tools existed for only one reason: to force the universe into unnatural shapes. They treated nature as an enemy, they were by definition a rebellion against the way things were. Technology is a stunted thing in benign environments, it never thrived in any culture gripped by belief in natural harmony. Why invent fusion reactors if your climate is comfortable, if your food is abundant? Why build fortresses if you have no enemies? Why force change upon a world that poses no threat?

- PREDATORS RUN FOR THEIR DINNER. PREY RUN FOR THEIR LIVES. —Old Ecologist’s Proverb ([Location 2690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=2690))
- PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED AT THE SAME LEVEL OF AWARENESS THAT CREATED THEM. —Albert Einstein ([Location 3705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=3705))
- WHY SHOULD MAN EXPECT HIS PRAYER FOR MERCY TO BE HEARD BY WHAT IS ABOVE HIM WHEN HE SHOWS NO MERCY TO WHAT IS UNDER HIM? —Pierre Troubetzkoy ([Location 4174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4174))
- This is how you communicate with a fellow intelligence: You hurt it, and keep on hurting it, until you can distinguish the speech from the screams. ([Location 4286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4286))
- IF I CAN BUT MAKE THE WORDS AWAKE THE FEELING. —Ian Anderson, Stand Up ([Location 4602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4602))
- “Vision’s mostly a lie anyway,” he continued. “We don’t really see anything except a few hi-res degrees where the eye focuses. Everything else is just peripheral blur, just … light and motion. Motion draws the focus. And your eyes jiggle all the time, did you know that, Keeton? Saccades, they’re called. Blurs the image, the movement’s way too fast for the brain to integrate so your eye just … shuts down between pauses. It only grabs these isolated freeze-frames, but your brain edits out the blanks and stitches an … an illusion of continuity into your head.” ([Location 4623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4623))
- YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU MAD. —Aldous Huxley ([Location 4849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4849))
- Make a conscious choice. Decide to move your index finger. Too late! The electricity’s already halfway down your arm. Your body began to act a full half-second before your conscious self “chose” to, for the self chose nothing; something else set your body in motion, sent an executive summary—almost an afterthought—to the homunculus behind your eyes. That little man, that arrogant subroutine that thinks of itself as the person, mistakes correlation for causality: It reads the summary and it sees the hand move, and it thinks that one drove the other. But it’s not in charge. You’re not in charge. If free will even exists, it doesn’t share living space with the likes of you. Insight, then. Wisdom. ([Location 4963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4963))
- The quest for knowledge, the derivation of theorems, science and technology and all those exclusively Human pursuits that must surely rest on a conscious foundation. Maybe that’s what sentience would be for—if scientific breakthroughs didn’t spring fully formed from the subconscious mind, manifest themselves in dreams, as full-blown insights after a deep night’s sleep. It’s the most basic rule of the stymied researcher: stop thinking about the problem. Do something else. It will come to you if you just stop being conscious of it. ([Location 4969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4969))
- Every concert pianist knows that the surest way to ruin a performance is to be aware of what the fingers are doing. Every dancer and acrobat knows enough to let the mind go, let the body run itself. Every driver of any manual vehicle arrives at destinations with no recollection of the stops and turns and roads traveled in getting there. You are all sleepwalkers, whether climbing creative peaks or slogging through some mundane routine for the thousandth time. You are all sleepwalkers. ([Location 4974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4974))
- Evolution has no foresight. Complex machinery develops its own agendas. Brains—cheat. Feedback loops evolve to promote stable heartbeats and then stumble upon the temptation of rhythm and music. The rush evoked by fractal imagery, the algorithms used for habitat selection, metastasize into art. Thrills that once had to be earned in increments of fitness can now be had from pointless introspection. Aesthetics rise unbidden from a trillion dopamine receptors, and the system moves beyond modeling the organism. It begins to model the very process of modeling. It consumes evermore computational resources, bogs itself down with endless recursion and irrelevant simulations. Like the parasitic DNA that accretes in every natural genome, it persists and proliferates and produces nothing but itself. Metaprocesses bloom like cancer, and awaken, and call themselves I. ([Location 4989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=4989))
- Centuries of navel-gazing. Millennia of masturbation. Plato to Descartes to Dawkins to Rhanda. Souls and zombie agents and qualia. Kolmogorov complexity. Consciousness as Divine Spark. Consciousness as electromagnetic field. Consciousness as functional cluster. ([Location 5158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=5158))
- Yet the questions persisted, in the minds of the laureates, in the angst of every horny fifteen-year-old on the planet. Am I nothing but sparking chemistry? Am I a magnet in the ether? I am more than my eyes, my ears, my tongue; I am the little thing behind those things, the thing looking out from inside. But who looks out from its eyes? What does it reduce to? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? What a stupid fucking question. I could have answered it in a second, if Sarasti hadn’t forced me to understand it first. ([Location 5171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=5171))
- NOT UNTIL WE ARE LOST DO WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES. —Henry David Thoreau ([Location 5177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=5177))
- The only explanation is that something has coded nonsense in a way that poses as a useful message; only after wasting time and effort does the deception becomes apparent. The signal functions to consume the resources of a recipient for zero payoff and reduced fitness. The signal is a virus. Viruses do not arise from kin, symbionts, or other allies. The signal is an attack. And it’s coming from right about there. ([Location 5368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=5368))
- Because if Sarasti was right, scramblers were the norm: Evolution across the universe was nothing but the endless proliferation of automatic, organized complexity, a vast arid Turing machine full of self-replicating machinery forever unaware of its own existence. And we—we were the flukes and the fossils. We were the flightless birds lauding our own mastery over some remote island while serpents and carnivores washed up on our shores. ([Location 5378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=5378))
- Metzinger’s Being No One19 ([Location 6185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=6185))
- Wegner’s The Illusion of Conscious Will20 ([Location 6197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=6197))
- Compared to nonconscious processing, self-awareness is slow and expensive102. (The premise of a separate, faster “emergency brain” lurking at the base of our primary one is taken from studies by Joe LeDoux, and others.107,108) ([Location 6232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=6232))
- If we’re so unfit, why haven’t we gone extinct? Why? Because natural selection takes time, and luck plays a role. The game isn’t over. The game is never over; and so, neither can there be any winners. There are only those who haven’t yet lost. ([Location 6247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=6247))
- “At some point in our evolution, we started to make decisions consciously, and we’re not very good at it.”115 ([Location 6262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003K15EKM&location=6262))
