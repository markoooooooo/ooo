- Much as Kant argued, space and time appear to be our cognitive filters, not some perfect reflection of what is really “out there,” or, I dare add, of what we are really capable of knowing. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=433))

- In such a model, what we experience as “reality” is a function of our evolved cognitive and sensory systems interacting with the real in very selective and limited ways. Put most simply, our reality is a pragmatic one, not an exhaustive or even a particularly accurate one. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=669))

- Have you ever actually sat down and listened to what quantum physicists or cosmologists are saying about the nature of matter and the structure of the universe? To any ordinary mortal, it is all pure craziness: matter as congealed energy, the relativity of space and time, nonlocality, entangled particles that communicate instantly across space-time, multiple dimensions that the primate brain simply cannot imagine or picture, dark energy that, we are now told, constitutes the vast majority of the universe, a “big bang” out of nowhere and nothing, parallel universes, and on and on we go into one impossible thing after another. And yet, we are told, this is precisely what the empirical evidence and mathematics point toward. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=706))
- global archival base on childhood reincarnation memories and strange birthmarks collected by the psychiatrist Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia, which now stand at about 2,700 cases. But that is another story, which has been told and documented numerous times and which noted skeptics have described as impressive.8 ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=825))
- The point is that A. J. Ayer, one of the most rigorous philosophical thinkers of the twentieth century, was willing and able to think entirely outside his familiar boxes about these subjects after his near-death experience, but not before it. He was willing to be flipped, even if he never quite flipped, not at least in this life that those of us who have not died can perceive and confirm. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=836))
- William James called these moments “noetic.” What he meant by this Greek-based word is that such experiences carry a direct knowledge that cannot be reduced or explained by any simple cognition or sensory input. One can think of this as knowing something directly without or outside the “filter” of the brain and its various cognitive and sensory mediations. Consciousness, freed from those buffers and blocks, simply knows. Here is another future form of knowledge that is also ancient.

- Infinite Awareness: The Awakening of a Scientific Mind. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1074))
- Shermer recognizes, in my own words, that the force and power of the paranormal do not lie in any posited mechanism (a battery or wire being suddenly jarred into place, for example). They lie in the meaning and human emotion that the event effortlessly expressed. Put a bit differently, such paranormal events have little to do with the methods of conventional science and everything to do with our humanity and, at least in this case, with love. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1142))
- In the words of Jason Josephson-Storm, Curie “was conjuring ghosts or studying paranormal manifestations as part of her physics research.”51 ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1163))
- the “Pauli Effect.” ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1168))
- Alan Turing, the great British mathematician, codebreaker, and computer pioneer was convinced that telepathy is real: “These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately, the statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one’s ideas so as to fit these new facts in.”52 That ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1169))
- “Somehow or other I had vaguely thought of myself as inhabiting this house which is my body, and looking out its two round windows at the world.” Not anymore. “I see the man over there [in the mirror] … as the opposite in every way of my real Self here. I have never been anything but this ageless, adamantine, measureless, lucid, and altogether immaculate Void.” ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1174))
- Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett would later anthologize Harding’s compelling case. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1177))
- two major books that came out of it: Irreducible Mind and Beyond Physicalism. Together, these volumes remain the single most substantial and provocative challenge to conventional materialist interpretations of science that we possess. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1183))
- The universe evolves toward consciousness, toward eyes that see and minds that perceive and, eventually, come to know that they know. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1235))
- Morris pulled no punches in a public lecture he gave at Princeton University in May 2013.2 The first punch was in the title: “Nine Evolutionary Myths: The Closing of the Darwinian Mind.” It is difficult to listen to the lecture and not conclude that the subtitle ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1237))
- The Runes of Evolution, ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1246))
- Albert Einstein memorably quipped that “[t]he eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.” He even called this comprehensibility a “miracle.” ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1282))
- Significantly, Einstein equated this cosmically attuned mind with a most basic and most profound religious sensibility, a “peculiar religious feeling” specific to the scientist, but one that had journeyed very far from its historical roots in figures like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton.7 Each of these men understood the mathematical laws and geometrical structures of the world to be ultimately located in the mind of God. ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1289))
- In effect, such thinkers had accepted Descartes’s earlier splitting of reality into two separate realms (the mental and the material) but then completely ignored one half of it as unimportant, even nonexistent. Newton’s mechanics worked wonders with the “Quantity or Number” thing but said absolutely nothing about the mental world (even though Newton himself was obsessed with theological, occult, and esoteric matters). The eventual result was an entirely objective, mechanical reality completely devoid not only of God but of any mental or conscious dimension whatsoever, a reality entirely independent of any conscious observer or personal dimension. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1302))
- This was what would eventually become the reigning “positivism” of scientific orthodoxy, which came down to this: The full truth about the material world resides only in mathematics, meaningful concepts can only be stated as quantities, and no other language is real knowledge. In short, David Hume. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1308))
- “The most beautiful and most profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead.” ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1312))
- Einstein warned his listeners not to confuse the technical and mathematical successes of science with the assumed truth of the scientists’ present interpretations of the sciences, which, in his own language, are little more than temporary “illusions.” He openly proclaimed the need for a new religious or spiritual orientation, one inspired, purified, and guided by modern science: ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1331))
- Put a bit differently, it was Bohr’s position that uncertainty is not a function of an incomplete theory whose loopholes we will eventually close, which was contrary to Einstein’s position. Rather, uncertainty and indeterminacy are woven into the very nature of things. To invoke the lovely paradoxical phrase of Abner Shimony, quantum reality is “objectively indefinite.”16 ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1364))
- Bell’s Theorem was later repeatedly tested under increasingly sophisticated laboratory conditions at the University of California, Berkeley (John Clauser and colleagues), at the University of Paris at Orsay (Alain Aspect and colleagues), and at the University of Geneva (Nicolus Gisin and colleagues). The eventual results were unequivocal but also bizarre in the extreme. Put simply, they demonstrated conclusively that Bohr was right and Einstein was wrong. Put less personally and more complexly, they provided empirical confirmation of the phenomenon of “entanglement”—the very phenomena Einstein considered absurd and impossible. In lay terms, these empirical tests demonstrated that particles that have once interacted become “entangled” and thereafter correlate with one another’s internal states (like “spin”) instantly, regardless of the spatial or temporal distances the two particles have since traveled. Entangled particles form an indivisible whole and cannot be treated as if they were separate from one another. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1378))
- Consider the following gloss on what Bell’s Theorem implies by the philosopher of science Robert Nadeau and the physicist Menas Kafatos after their own fifteen-year dialogue: ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1404))
- All particles in the history of the cosmos have interacted with other particles in the manner revealed by the [entanglement] experiments… from the big bang to the present. Even the atoms in our bodies are made up of particles that were once in close proximity to the cosmic fireball, and other particles that interacted at that time in a single quantum state can be found in the most distant star. Also consider … that quantum entanglement grows exponentially with the number of particles involved in the original quantum state and that there is no theoretical limit on the number of these entangled particles. If this is the case, the universe on a very basic level could be a vast web of particles, which remain in contact with one another over any distance in “no time” in the absence of the transfer of energy or information. This suggests, however strange or bizarre it might seem, that all of physical reality is a single quantum system that responds together to further interactions.18 ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1406))
- In the new quantum real, there can be no reductionism in the classical sense, since the organization of the “particles” lies inside themselves, as it were, within that strange phenomenon called entanglement. There is no external communication, no chemical reactions, no information signal “between” this and that particle. There is only an instantaneous response from nature outside of space and outside of time. It is as if everything is already one thing and is simply responding to itself, evolving itself through time. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1419))
- For example, consider the predictable rebuttals to my earlier observations about the strange resonances between the apparent philosophical implications of quantum mechanics and comparative mystical literature, particularly the latter’s insistence that consciousness is fundamental. Such rebuttals come down to (a) some false conflation with or confusion between consciousness and cognition, or between consciousness and the brain, or between consciousness and social ego or personal self (all conflations or confusions that the mystical literature strongly denies and deconstructs); or (b) some version of materialism or physicalism that wants to deny the existence of consciousness as such altogether. In other words, all the rebuttals come down to an unexamined commitment to Newtonian physicalism and a rejection of any form of fundamental subjectivity or first-person direct knowledge. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1432))
- The mirror is trying to mirror, become aware of, itself. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1472))
- We are in this way caught, immediately, in a fundamental paradox that will never be resolved by studying more objects. I see no way around it: At some point, we will have to “turn around” and look back into the mirror itself. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1476))
- The single big question that drives most of the modern philosophy of mind is this: “What is the relationship between mind and matter, and how is this relationship mediated or produced by the brain?” On the surface, this is a remarkably easy question to understand. We experience the material world “out there.” We experience ourselves as conscious beings “in here.” So how are this “inside” and that “outside” related? ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1515))
- in 1927 by Bertrand Russell in The Analysis of Matter).20 ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1524))
- The philosopher of mind Philip Goff points out with particular verve that since Galileo, the physical sciences have proceeded by putting aside the ontological question (the is question) and focusing only on the behavior or structure question: ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1525))
- Physics tell us nothing about what an electron is beyond what it does.21 ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1532))
- “Physics leaves us completely in the dark about the underlying concrete reality of the physical universe.”22 ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1537))
- But for Goff, no such third-person empirical approach will ever get us to an adequate understanding of consciousness as a first-person presence. No experiment can get us there, because “the reality of consciousness is a datum in its own right, a datum distinct from the data of third-person observation and experiment.”23 ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1540))
- Goff thinks this looking into the microscope involves two sources of data: (1) the findings of the sciences with respect to the causal structures of the material world (particularly quantum physics), and (2) “the direct first-person access each of us has to the nature of consciousness,” or what he calls simply “the datum of consciousness.”26 ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1553))
- In recent Western intellectual history (in the last half millennium or so), three answers have dominated the discussion, and in more or less this historical order: dualism, idealism, and materialism. ([Location 1558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1558))
- “I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.”27 ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1568))
- Indeed, the “hard” problem of consciousness, as David Chalmers famously dubbed it, is often singled out as the most important question in all of modern science. Only the nature of “life” in the biological sciences comes close. And many thinkers suspect that these two questions—”What is consciousness?” and “What is life?”—are, in fact, the same question in two different guises. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1585))
- Dual-aspect monists, then, possess an elegant answer to how we arrive at our daily experience of twoness, that is—how we arrive at our common sense of being an interior subject perceiving an exterior reality. Our ordinary experience of being “inside” a body looking “outside” is a result of this deeper superreality being split into two experienced dimensions by the brain-body and its particular adaptive needs and spatial and temporal perspective. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1674))
- For a thinker like Atmanspacher, the phenomenal experience of time itself is also created by this symmetry breaking of the deeper reality. Ultimately, there is no inside or outside, no subject or object. Ultimately, there is no stream of time and no structured space. There is only a fundamental oneness that is neither mental nor material. This is what Pauli and Jung called the holistic One World (unus mundus). ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1677))
- The felt atomism and pluralism of panpsychism is thus answered by a radical monism that is, in the end, inaccessible to human thinking and ordinary human experience (a very important qualification, as we shall see in a moment), since the latter is always an after-the-fact function of the split “up here,” well above the One World. We do not just experience this split as the typical subjective-objective structure of our phenomenal experience and grammar. We are this split.37 ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1685))
- Quantum Mind and Social Science: Unifying Physical and Social Ontology (2015), ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1699))
- Wendt advances the elegant thesis that most of the dilemmas around agency, subjectivity, freedom, and experience that philosophers and social scientists—and, by extension, I would add, virtually all humanists—struggle with are only problems if we restrict our thinking to what is now an outdated metaphysical world, that of Newtonian classical physics.38 The mind-matter problem, for example, is simply intractable within any classical material worldview, since it is this classical paradigm and its grammar of individual “subjects” and material “objects” that produce the presumed paradox of the mental and the material in the first place. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1699))
- Yes, of course, our bodies are classical objects, but our forms of consciousness are not. Mind and social life in particular are quantum mechanical phenomena for Wendt, not classical objects in three-dimensional space. Accordingly, they work like a quantum mechanical wave function (in the Copenhagen interpretation). Such a wave function is a potential reality, not an actual one. Moreover, it is by definition “plural,” “paradoxical,” and “multiple” (my terms), since the wave function is a set of probabilistic patterns mathematically superimposed upon one another. Until, that is, the same wave function is measured by a conscious agent and “collapses” into a singular material, measurable, empirical event or “particle.” ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1706))
- Mind is an expression of the quantum wave function. Matter is an expression of its collapse and observable measurement as a particle. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1713))
- Wendt is arguing that human forms of awareness, agency, freedom, and consciousness are literally quantum mechanical in nature. We are “walking wave functions.” This little phrase is, in fact, the repeated refrain of the book. ([Location 1718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1718))
- my claim is that life is a macroscopic instantiation of quantum coherence”40), and, ultimately, deep down to a “single underlying reality that is neither mental nor material but from which the distinction itself emerges.”41 ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1732))
- there is growing experimental evidence that human behavior in fact follows quantum principles. ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1745))
- key prediction of quantum consciousness theory, according to which our subjectivity is a macroscopic quantum mechanical phenomenon—that we are walking wave functions. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1746))
- classical figures like Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hegel). The physicist, coinventor of the microprocessor, and technological entrepreneur Federico Faggin ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1795))
- In one, Faggin presents matter and its mathematics as the “ink” with which consciousness writes its own self-knowing. The physical, mathematically structured world here becomes the mirrored means by which consciousness comes to know and reflect itself.49 ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1798))
- Bernardo Kastrup. ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1803))
- blog post for Scientific American, “Thinking Outside the Quantum Box,” in which he makes the case that “the particles do not exist independently of observation”; that “all physical quantities—the entire physical world—are relative to the observer, in a way analogous to motion”; and that, in the words of Richard Conn Henry in a 2005 Nature essay, “the Universe is entirely mental.” For Kastrup, all physical properties or behaviors are “the discernible configurations of a substrate,” which is mind.50 ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1824))
- hints at or gestures toward repeatedly in Dreamed Up Reality (2011), a book ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1831))
- In his sixth book, More Than Allegory ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1833))
- Here, Kastrup explains, we are embodied forms of cosmic mind, split off “alters” in some vast multiple-personality order. These alters have entered God’s dream through sexual reproduction and evolutionary biology in order to wake up within the dream, look around the physical universe as the interior of God’s brain, and reflect on our own cosmic nature within this same neural galactic network. Kastrup summarizes our cosmic condition this way: “Put in another way, the universe is a scan of God’s brain; except that you don’t need the scanner: you’re already inside God’s brain so all you have to do is look around. Your perceptions of the sun, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc., are as inaccessible to God as the patterns of firing neurons in your brain—with all their beauty and complexity—are inaccessible to you in any direct way.”52 We are the universe becoming self-aware. We know what God does not know, since we are “inside” God. But—and here is the even more astonishing thing—we have access to what God knows, since we are, in fact, embodied, particularized forms of this same cosmic mind. We exist in, and so can know, both levels of the real. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1836))
- we are all Christs, crucified on the cross of space and time: ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1850))
- “we are all hanging from the self-conceptualized cross of space-time, impermanence and confinement. ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1850))
- That Christ is both God and the Son of God born into God’s creation is a hardly disguised way to express this symbolically.”54 ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1852))
- It is an exploration of how cosmic consciousness projects itself into narrative forms, into story, or what we have come to call “myth,” and then wakes up out of that same story or myth to know itself not as other but as Self, as Mind, as consciousness as such before and beyond any single ego or organism. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1855))
- We may safely predict that it will be the timidity of our hypotheses, and not their extravagance, which will provoke the derision of posterity. —H. H. PRICE ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1859))
- First, I asked each to tell us the story of the strangest thing that ever happened to her or him. Second, I asked each of them to propose a theory of the imagination that would make this strange story understandable, or at least plausible. All of them had an exceptionally strange story. None of them had a theory of the imagination to explain it. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1869))
- This is the symbolic behavior of a living dream. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1884))
- If we are ever going to accept, much less understand, the reality and messages of these events, we are going to have to come to terms with the imagination and its power to shape both the mental and material. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1884))
- It all comes down to the in-between. We all assume, on some level, that there is a mental world “in here” and a material world “out there,” and that there is only one way that knowledge about that material world can get to this mental world—through the senses. In the modern secular world, we also generally assume that any form of knowledge—say in a big dream, a sudden precognitive intuition, or a near-death experience—is not real knowledge, since it is only “in the head” of the visionary. It is a hallucination. It is imagined and thus “imaginary.” ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1889))
- But this is not even true in the sciences. After all, the privileged mode of knowledge in the sciences is mathematics, an entirely formal or symbolic language that, for reasons that few people dare to think about, actually mirrors and maps the material world in eerily precise ways.3 And, although the mathematics of the sciences can be checked through experimentation and is related to observation, technically speaking, none of this mathematical knowledge comes through the senses. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1899))
- Mathematics is “symbolic” knowledge, by which I mean that it is not what it signifies but somehow participates in that which it signifies. No scientist or mathematician believes that the squiggly lines that we call “Arabic numbers” invented by medieval Muslim intellectuals exist as such out there, but all of science proceeds on the philosophical assumption that such numbers do, in fact, represent some relatively precise, pragmatically approximate, or reliable relationship between a human subject and an objective physical world—that is, between the mental and the material domains. ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1903))
- Numbers are symbols that mean something other than what they appear to mean (squiggly lines on a page, screen, or chalkboard) but nevertheless participate in some fundamental way in that which they symbolize (the workings of the physical world) and in that in which they appear (the human mind). In this way, they enable the human mind to commune indirectly with the deepest hidden structures of material reality. They join the knower and the known, the mental and the material. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1907))
- And, regardless of our present denials, symbolic processes continue to operate in extremely common human experiences, like dreams, literary, artistic, or intellectual creativity, as well as in more extreme and uncommon ones, like those of our flipped scientists. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1912))
- Because this deeper ground of being is before and beyond all mental or material form, and is neither mental nor material, it cannot “speak” in human language or even in mathematics. It is of an entirely different ontological order, and so it “speaks” to us in the only way it can: in superstrange images, open paradoxes, and bizarre or absurd narratives. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1920))
- There are also more secular, purely horizontal examples today. Self-described “party-loving jock” and “college dropout” Jason Padgett is such a case. Despite never making it past pre-algebra, after getting struck on the head during a violent mugging, he became a kind of mathematical genius who “sees” geometric and fractal patterns in the natural world, from the flowing of water to the shape of leaves on a tree. He is now interested in number theory and has been described as both a savant and synesthetic prodigy.4 Here mathematical and visionary forms of knowledge work together in perfect tandem, probably because they ultimately draw on the same deep structures of the human mind. Please note that it was a brain injury that released such powers. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1929))
- Subjective states and objective events were arising together in order to express meaning. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1944))
- What the conventional consensus essentially says to such an astonished or flipped human being is this: “Never mind. Move on. Empiricism is great, until it conflicts with our assumptions.” All sorts of “rules” are then invoked to police and protect this consensus.

- The contemporary classicist Peter T. Struck has recently given us a profound history of the symbol and its three-millennium run in Western history in Birth of the Symbol. ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2049))
- He shows us how the ancient Greeks came to mark these genres with a number of words, the most important of which was symbola or “symbols.” In Struck’s elegant expression, such symbols marked “the limits of their texts,” that is, the places where the oracle, the poem, the myth, or the philosophical riddle carried their readers and listeners over into a realm of experience and truth that could not be captured by ordinary thinking or by any simple description. ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2056))
- The word symbol itself is significant. It refers to two things “put together” (sym-ballein). It originally had nothing to do with literary or religious mysteries. Rather, the term invoked the notions of an “agreement,” the token that authenticates a “contract,” a “passport,” or “watchword,” or—much closer to the later meanings—an “ominous chance meeting” on the road signaling some divine intentionality or hidden purpose. ([Location 2059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2059))
- The logic of the symbol can also be read as an expression of a dual-aspect monism—that is, an ontology that assumes a deeper oneness from which a twoness emerges and between which the communication/communion/contract takes place. A symbol here is not a message from a source to a receiver, nor is it an arbitrary projection of a human being, but a coded meaning or message that appears between a subject and an object, or between the mental and the material domains.

- Today, the more nuanced position is called “physicalism,” by which is meant the thesis “that the complete nature of fundamental reality can in principle be captured in the vocabulary of the natural sciences,” particularly physics.28 ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1573))
- Dreamed Up Reality and More than Allegory. Because Kastrup ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2129))
- … in consensus reality synchronization emerges across the imaginations of multiple conscious entities, so to form a coherent shared picture. The constraints entailed by such emergent synchronization may be what we call the laws of physics. Perhaps the apparently fixed mechanisms of nature are merely an epiphenomenon; an emergent property of the sympathetic harmonization of different imaginations, imagination itself being the true primary substance of reality. Perhaps the laws of physics can themselves be reduced to a fundamental metaphysics of psyche.18 ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2144))
- “there seems to be no distinction between the process of perceiving and the process of conceiving.”19, 20 ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2155))
- What this actually looked like to him in his own altered states was a geometric world that expresses information through Christmas ball–like globes, “Kandinsky scintilla” (after the esoterically inclined abstract artist), mandalalike patterns, alien sci-fi landscapes, and fractal patterns, all of which he also illustrates in his book with computer-generated (that is, mathematically generated) images. ([Location 2169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2169))
- I take science itself as one of our best guides here. In order to advance our knowledge of particle physics, we had to build billion-dollar technologies to expose matter to some of the most extreme and violent conditions in the universe. Only then did matter display some of its deepest secrets in the form of quantum fields, which, in turn, gave us a window into the high-energy states of the early cosmos. While ethically we cannot expose people to extreme and violent conditions, life does this for us. ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2223))

- A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the “Universe,” a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest—a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons near us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.1 ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2356))
- I can purchase objects with a socially constructed abstraction called “money,” but even when the thing is home and sitting on my desk or in my living room, or wherever it is sitting, the laws of physics keep me from actually ever touching it completely (for every touch is not really a touch, but a repelling of forces on an atomic level). In truth, I own nothing. ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2363))
- “You can’t take it with you.” And you don’t even really have it here. All you can do even in a Newtonian world is get close to things for a while. ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2366))
- It was Whitman, often called the first and greatest of American poets, who first used the word spirituality in this modern sense (in his 1871 book, Democratic Vistas). He meant a mystical worldview that grounds democracy, a radical comparative orientation that saw all religions and all scriptures as organic and diverse expressions of an unacknowledged cosmic nature—our own. ([Location 2510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2510))
- (Spiegelberg had been flipped by his own mystical experience in a wheat field in 1917). ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2560))
- Timothy Morton’s “dark ecology” is especially relevant here.16 ([Location 2649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2649))
- We are all living in a Philip K. Dick reality now, a world in which we are the main actors on the global stage, and everything we think we are doing to and with “nature,” we are actually doing to and with ourselves, since we are nature become conscious of itself. We are hunting, farming, polluting, warming, and destroying ourselves. ([Location 2657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2657))
- Dark ecology, he writes, “is how we find ourselves in a story we have written, and the next part is becoming conscious authors of the story we are writing.”20 ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2664))
- Morton detects this future humankind in particular genres of art, particularly science fiction, for “art is thought from the future”—that is, “[t]hought we cannot presently think at the present.”21 ([Location 2665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2665))
- Émile Durkheim and his followers have put it: Religion is society worshipping itself. ([Location 2668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2668))
- Or as Freud had it in The Future of an Illusion, all the gods and every God is a projection of the human, and an immature, if not actually infantile, one at that. ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2669))
- So here is my proposed flip: If all gods are in fact projections of us, then there is something about us, which we cannot yet own or admit, that is godlike. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2670))
- Such a realization of being caught in a story we ourselves are writing as unconscious gods can be terrifying, depressing, even nihilistic. Morton attempts to move us from the dark depression to the sweet gnosis of directly knowing who and what we already are. And what we already are is truly fantastic: 5-D or “X-beings” endowed with spectral superpowers that give witness to the future human, a massive transdimensional hyperobject awakening to its own actual condition, connected to everything there is, and literally and truly cosmic.22 ([Location 2671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2671))
- So, the 5-D Them, the superbeings, are not super in the sense of having transcended time and space or having achieved ultimate mastery; nor is being your own author a question of mastery, but a deeply confusing matter of self-haunting, as anyone who has had a paranormal experience will affirm. They are deeply ambiguous. Am I having something real or is this an illusion or delusion? What type of illusion? What form of real? Am I in someone else’s story or am I writing my own?23 ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2678))
- C. P. Snow (1905–1980), an English chemist and novelist, argued in a slim little book entitled The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution that we have two separate and largely incommunicable intellectual cultures in the West: a humanistic or literary one, and a scientific or technological one.

- She thus relates different forms of consciousness that arise from the collective cooperation of trillions of living intelligent cells, or she describes the deep inner peace she felt as being the “neurological circuitry located in our right brain.”26 “I believe the experience of Nirvana exists in the consciousness of our right hemisphere, and that at any moment, we can choose to hook into that part of our brain.”27 ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2751))
- “Because everything around us … is composed of spinning and vibrating atomic particles, you and I are literally swimming in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic fields. We are part of it. We are enveloped within it, and through our sensory apparatus we experience what is.”33 ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2771))

- If the past is any measure, the future of knowledge, too, may emerge from the margins. ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2819))
- Contrary to the strict division of the activity of the human spirit into separate departments—a division prevailing since the nineteenth century—I consider the ambition of overcoming opposites, including also a synthesis embracing both rational understanding and the mystical experience of unity, to be the mythos, spoken and unspoken, of our present day and age.2 ([Location 2827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2827))
- Quantum physics is a “flipped science,” one in which consciousness is no longer understood as an epiphenomenon, but as fundamental to the very nature of nature. If consciousness is fundamental here, it stands to reason that it will someday become so in evolutionary biology and cosmology, which depend entirely on the quantum physical field as their substratum and base.
