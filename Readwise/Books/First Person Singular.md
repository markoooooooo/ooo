## Highlights
- In the opening of Anna Karenina, Tolstoy wrote, “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1486))
- I believe (and please take this for what it is, just my personal view) that beautiful woman can be summed up by simply being “beautiful.” Each one of them is carrying around a single beautiful, golden-haired monkey on her back. There might be a slight difference in the luster and shade of their fur, but the brilliance they share makes them all seem one and the same. In contrast, ugly women each carry around their own individual version of a shaggy monkey. There are small, but significant, differences in their monkeys—how worn their fur is, where their fur has thinned out, how dirty they are. There’s no brilliance at all, so unlike the golden-haired monkeys, our eyes are not dazzled by them. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1488))
- Schumann’s Carnaval ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1539))
- Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli’s recording for Angel Records, ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1567))
- Arthur Rubinstein’s RCA recording. ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1568))
- Of course, winning is much better than losing. No argument there. But winning or losing doesn’t affect the weight and value of the time. It’s the same time, either way. A minute is a minute, an hour is an hour. We need to cherish it. We need to deftly reconcile ourselves with time, and leave behind as many precious memories as we can—that’s what’s the most valuable. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F7JMJ3B&location=1919))
