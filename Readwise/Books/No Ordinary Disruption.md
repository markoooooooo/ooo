- In contrast, between 2010 and 2025, 440 cities in developing nations will generate nearly half of global GDP growth.27 ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=434))
- Cities exhibit superlinear scaling characteristics; with every doubling of a city’s population, each inhabitant becomes, on average, 15 percent wealthier, more productive, and more innovative. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=471))
- TechCity in London, 1871 in Chicago, 1776 in Washington, DC, and 22@ in Barcelona are all examples of such urban collaborative spaces. In San Francisco, SFMade, a nonprofit set up in 2010, seeks to promote local manufacturing in the city. In New York, Made in NYC has a similar aim, looking to support nearly seven thousand small local manufacturers. And in Europe, organizations such as Design for Manufacturing Forum connect industrial designers, engineers, and manufacturers ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=483))

- Over the past two decades, the amplifying forces of industrialization, technology, and the urbanization of emerging economies have driven incomes higher for billions of people, lifting 700 million out of poverty and adding 1.2 billion new members to the consuming class.10 From a societal perspective, this level of poverty eradication prevents more deaths from poverty-related diseases and hunger than the lives saved per year through eradication of smallpox, often hailed as the greatest health-care achievement of the twentieth century. ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1712))
- By 2030, almost six hundred million people with annual income greater than $20,000 a year will live in emerging markets—roughly 60 percent of the global total. ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1733))
- The annual consumption in emerging markets will reach $30 trillion by 2025. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1763))
- •  They will think of the next opportunity in terms of cities and urban clusters, not regions or countries, and reallocate their capital and talent accordingly.        •  They will customize and price products to meet local tastes and needs and will build faster, lower-cost supply chains and innovative business models in order to be cost competitive and deliver price points across a broad spectrum.        •  They will design and control multichannel routes to market and rethink their brand and marketing and sales strategies.        •  They will overhaul organizational structures, talent strategy, and operating practices to reflect the new shift.

- Many global companies, for example, make the mistake of conducting Brazilian consumer research in São Paulo, not realizing that the cosmopolitan city has more in common culturally with New York, 4,771 miles away, than with Curitiba, the capital of Parana state (population 1.7 million), which is just 210 miles away. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1835))
- For new entrants to Brazil, the populous but historically poor northeast of the country, where boomtowns like Salvador are expected to grow 2.4-fold by 2015, may offer better prospects, even if setting up operations is more difficult.35 This is not exactly a new idea. Walmart grew into America’s largest retailer from the inside of the country out, finding underserved towns and avoiding highly competitive metropolitan markets. ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1853))
- By understanding the dynamics of the product category and the local marketplace, companies can time market entry—ideally right before a category enters the hot zone—and benefit from the fastest growth stage in each city. ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1861))
- Seek, rather, to understand markets on their own terms. A careful understanding of local tastes and flavor preferences propelled consumer goods companies such as Frito-Lay in India and Tingyi and Wrigley in China to meteoric growth.

- VF Corporation, one of the ten largest fashion companies in the world, redesigned the way it manages its supply chains in response to an increasingly expanding footprint. Relying on an integrated IT system, VF designed “The Third Way,” in which different brands in its portfolio aggregate their sourcing needs in order to create economies of scale. The company also works closely with manufacturers so that it can produce many different branded products in a single factory. From the mid-to-late 2000s, doing so allowed VF to reduce the production cost of jeans and other apparel by between 5 and 10 percent.

- IBM, which gets 64 percent of its sales outside the United States, now runs human resources from Manila, accounting from Kuala Lumpur, procurement from Shenzhen, and customer service from Brisbane for its Japan business.

- “In some ways, capital is easier to reallocate than people—you can sit in Brussels, look at the annual capital flows of the different businesses, and act accordingly,” said Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, chief executive officer of Solvay, the Belgian chemicals company. “With people, there is always a tendency to manage in geographic or business ‘silos.’ That’s why we have recently established a new principle: that the top 300 people in the group are corporate assets.”56 In other words, the company’s leading employees will be rotated across global operations based on local needs and growth rather than remaining at the company’s headquarters. ([Location 1994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=1994))
- Our observation, however, is that companies experience success when they are able to break away from the “investing in a market” mentality and give local leaders sufficient freedom to chart their own path. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2004))
- In South Korea, L’Oréal became the top choice for female sales and marketing talent by creating greater opportunities for brand managers and by improving working hours and child-care infrastructure. In India, Unilever has attracted top Indian talent by creating a global leadership program that includes rotation and permanent placement programs.

- The rise of a new class of consumers around the world is imposing a tough new set of requirements on established companies. Advantages in a home market can’t be easily replicated or taken for granted in far-flung markets. But the opportunities are too large to ignore. As impressive as recent growth has been, the process is just beginning. With each passing day, more people are moving from rural areas to cities, more ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2018))
- people are going online and plugging in, and more people are joining the ranks of the world’s consumers. As a result, more organizations may find, as Clarks Village did, that the world is beating a new, entirely unpredicted path to their doorstep—at the same time that consumers in markets previously considered closed off are acquiring a taste for the types of products they make. Smart companies that systematically rethink the way they approach, manage, and serve all the world’s promising markets can figure out how to meet customers where they are—and where they will be.

- The prices of a basket of key commodities—including energy, metals, food, and water—had fallen by almost half in real terms during the twentieth century. This remarkable development occurred despite the fact that the world’s population quadrupled and global GDP per capita increased nearly fivefold.11 The falling prices were all the more remarkable considering that rising standards of living and energy intensity helped push demand for commodities up by between 600 and 2,000 percent.12 Significant advances in productivity—the application of steam power to mining, the widespread mechanization of agriculture, the construction of massive dams—helped humanity exert more effective control over the production, distribution, trade, and storage of commodities. Falling commodity prices served as a major tailwind, helping world economic output expand more than twenty times in the twentieth century. And with the exception of the oil crises of the 1970s, productivity in the use of resources was not a priority. But this important trend has decisively ended. Thanks in large measure to sharply rising demand and to challenges to supply in key commodity sectors like oil and water, resource prices have doubled on average between 2000 and 2013.13 The average price of a range of energy sources shot up by 260 percent in this period. Metals prices surged by 176 percent, copper by 344 percent, and steel by 167 percent. Food prices, which fell by an average of 0.7 percent a year during the twentieth century, rose by almost 120 percent between 2000 and 2013.

- And what a story it has been. Since 1991, India’s GDP per capita has increased nearly fivefold, the nation’s foreign exchange reserves have increased nearly fiftyfold, and annual foreign direct investment ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2366))
- Estimates are that India will rise from the tenth-largest economy in the world in 2013 to the third largest by 2030.4 India’s young and rapidly urbanizing population could become the country’s “demographic dividend,” fueling growth and prosperity over the decades to come. By 2030, India could have an urban population of approximately six hundred million, nearly twice that of the entire United States as of this writing. India will be home to two of the world’s five most populous cities, along with sixty-eight other cities of more than one million inhabitants each.

- As the emerging world continues to industrialize and urbanize, its need for investment is surging. From Kumasi to Mumbai, from Porto Alegre to Kuala Lumpur, capital-intensive building projects are being planned. As countries invest in infrastructure, the additional demand will be amplified by companies seeking to invest in new capacity, equipment, and upgrades in order to keep up with disruptive technologies. These demands on capital will coincide with an aging global population and long-term government deficits—which will put pressure on the world’s pool of savings just as demand picks up. Based on the traditional view of macroeconomic fundamentals, the combination of rising demand and pressure on supply spells one outcome: a world with tighter, more expensive capital. Central bank actions have come at the end of a thirty-year period of declining interest ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2416))
- However, the unconventional monetary policy of recent years has taken us into uncharted territory and may have laid the foundations for a different, less easily comprehended world. It is one in which central banks and governments are always ready to step in and inject sufficient liquidity into the economy to keep it growing and keep interest rates low. Governments, of course, have been among the chief beneficiaries of these low rates. It is a world of fragile equilibriums, where periods of aggressive expansion of money supply may be followed by asset bubbles, inflationary challenges, and booms and busts of currencies. An increasing number of countries are exploring this new territory. In fact, we may be on the brink of transition into a world where expansive monetary policy and debt monetization—once considered taboo—become normal components of the central banks’ repertoire.

- We can’t always rely on the market to deliver capital precisely where and when it is needed in precisely the right amount. ([Location 2440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2440))
- Brazil, Indonesia, India, and China need a lot of bricks and mortar. The world’s growing cities will need to double their stock of physical capital investment from nearly $10 trillion in 2013 to more than $20 trillion by 2025.18 All the people moving to cities will need apartments to live in, roads to drive on, and schools to attend. ([Location 2447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2447))
- The US Department of Transportation has estimated that spending on public transit will have to increase by approximately 40 percent per year to bring it to a state of “good repair” by 2028. ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2464))
- Overall, we calculate that through 2030, the world needs to spend an estimated $57 trillion to $67 trillion on roads, buildings, rails, telecoms, ports, and water just to enable expected economic growth.25 That’s more than the entire worldwide stock of infrastructure on the ground today—and nearly 60 percent more than the world invested between 1994 and 2012.26 These investments, combined with the need to replace depreciated or outdated capital, will drive global total investment to $25 trillion by 2030 from $13 trillion in 2008, the peak before the financial crisis. ([Location 2465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=2465))
- Should interest rates rise, overruns can prove fatal. Based on our experience across sectors, a combination of project reprioritization, shortening of project life cycles, and tight project execution can deliver as much as a 10 to 25 percent reduction in spending and a 20 to 50 percent reduction in delays.47 A real estate company in the Middle East, for example, reduced cycle time by 30 percent for a $500 million tower project by taking advantage of lean management techniques—such as performance dialogues and war rooms—and prefabricating forms for beams and construction joints. These efforts allowed it to avoid $50 million in penalties for time overruns, while reducing the overall cost.

- In the five-year period ending in 2012, Asian carmakers reported a ratio of capital expenditures to revenue that was 30 percent lower than that of their European counterparts.50 Many companies can also seek to optimize their working capital productivity by adapting collection terms or cutting inventory. Take Tesla as an example. By requiring customers to pay $2,500 to $5,000 to make a reservation for purchase, the electric car manufacturer not only obtains a clearer view of the demand pipeline but minimizes the working capital necessary to run its operations.51 In effect, Tesla has managed to get its customers to provide its working capital. In December 2013, Tesla held customer deposits in excess of $160 million.52 Amazon, as another example, keeps only the fastest-moving items in stock in all of its distribution centers, carefully using advanced technology to pick the right items and stock levels. Taking immediate payments from customers and paying its suppliers with a month delay, Amazon operates with negative working capital. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Amazon reported accounts receivable of $4.77 billion and accounts payable of $15.133 billion, giving it a “float” of more than $10 billion of extremely cheap capital.53 If the top 10 global retailers had Amazon’s cash conversion cycle, they would collectively save over $150 billion in working capital.

- Exploit New Commercial Opportunities Companies with access to privileged sources of capital will have a clear competitive advantage. Considering that more than 70 percent of global growth—and associated new investment opportunities—will come from emerging markets, gaining exposure to these growth markets and understanding their capital restrictions and financial regulation is becoming essential for investors. Just as trade in goods and services is increasingly connecting nodes in the developing world to one another, so too is the trade in money.

- MGI’s projections suggest that emerging economies will be home to half of the Fortune Global 500 by 2025. ([Location 3015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=3015))
- Our research suggests that emerging-market companies are growing more than twice as quickly as their counterparts in developed economies.18 Over the coming decade, the GDP of emerging markets may increase by a factor of 2.5, which will reset the global competition landscape. Seven out of ten of the new “billion-level” companies—firms with annual sales of more than $1 billion—are likely to be based in emerging regions. The number of large companies based in these countries could increase from 2,200 today to around 7,000. If that holds true, China alone will house more large companies than either the United States or Western Europe by 2025.19 ([Location 3063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VTSI&location=3063))
