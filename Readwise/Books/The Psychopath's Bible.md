## Highlights
- never say exactly what you mean if you want the cooperation of the coward. No matter how pathetic, everyone is looking out for their best interests. For most people, their best interests consist of not being punished. Few play to win. They play to be safe while feeling morally superior to the winners.

- Don’t let anyone fool you about this. There are millions—billions—of people who believe all kinds of lies and still do well. Some people believe the truth and are utter failures. Life is tolerant, even stupidly so. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009RCO07G&location=424))
- Help others get what they want. This is the most insidious form of destroying them. It makes them instantly terminal and, in most cases, useless. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009RCO07G&location=614))
- Peter Principle. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009RCO07G&location=615))
- It is better to live with danger and chaos than with security. Your chances of surviving long enough and with enough power are much greater. This is another fundamental principle of Toxick Magick. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009RCO07G&location=621))
- These individuals know how to extend their power by being sort of unconscious of what they are doing. Awareness interferes with their activities. One way of recognizing them is from the trails of people they leave behind—people who think they have been helped. In fact, these people have been made into Zombies who later will be used in one way or another to accomplish the desired end of Pandemonium.
