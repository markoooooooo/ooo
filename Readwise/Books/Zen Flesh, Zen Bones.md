- ZEN STUDENTS are with their masters at least ten years before they presume to teach others. Nan-in was visited by Tenno, who, having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher. The day happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and carried an umbrella. After greeting him Nan-in remarked: “I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule. I want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of the clogs.” Tenno, confused, had no instant answer. He realized that he was unable to carry his Zen every minute. He became Nan-in’s pupil, and he studied six more years to accomplish his every-minute Zen. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=628))
- “The giver should be thankful.” ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=816))
- GASAN instructed his adherents one day: “Those who speak against killing and who desire to spare the lives of all conscious beings are right. It is good to protect even animals and insects. But what about those persons who kill time, what about those who are destroying wealth, and those who destroy political economy? We should not overlook them. Furthermore, what of the one who preaches without enlightenment? He is killing Buddhism.” ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=914))
- ZENGETSU, A CHINESE master of the T’ang dynasty, wrote the following advice for his pupils: Living in the world yet not forming attachments to the dust of the world is the way of a true Zen student. When witnessing the good action of another encourage yourself to follow his example. Hearing of the mistaken action of another, advise yourself not to emulate it. Even though alone in a dark room, be as if you were facing a noble guest. Express your feelings, but become no more expressive than your true nature. Poverty is your treasure. Never exchange it for an easy life. A person may appear a fool and yet not be one. He may only be guarding his wisdom carefully. Virtues are the fruit of self-discipline and do not drop from heaven of themselves as does rain or snow. Modesty is the foundation of all virtues. Let your neighbors discover you before you make yourself known to them. A noble heart never forces itself forward. Its words are as rare gems, seldom displayed and of great value. To a sincere student, every day is a fortunate day. Time passes but he never lags behind. Neither glory nor shame can move him. Censure yourself, never another. Do not discuss right and wrong. Some things, though right, were considered wrong for generations. Since the value of righteousness may be recognized after centuries, there is no need to crave an immediate appreciation. Live with cause and leave results to the great law of the universe. Pass each day in peaceful contemplation. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=1034))
- “If before you yourself die your son should die, this would grieve you greatly. If your grandson should pass away before your son, both of you would be broken-hearted. If your family, generation after generation, passes away in the order I have named, it will be the natural course of life. I call this real prosperity.” ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=1053))
- “No work, no food.” ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=1099))
- Don’t waste your life merely sensing; channel thought and feeling to one purpose—and then let it happen. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=1271))

- It is too clear and so it is hard to see. A dunce once searched for a fire with a lighted lantern. Had he known what fire was, He could have cooked his rice much sooner. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D1PP23J&location=1426))
