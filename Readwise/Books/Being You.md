## Highlights
- And for each one of us, conscious experiences change throughout life, from the blooming and buzzing confusion of early life, through the apparent though probably illusory and certainly not universal clarity of adulthood, and on to our final drift into the gradual – and for some, disorientingly rapid – dissolution of the self as neurodegenerative decay sets in. At each stage in this process you exist, but the notion that there is a single unique conscious self (a soul?) that persists over time may be grossly mistaken.

- Is consciousness possible without self-consciousness, and if so would it still matter so much? ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=120))
- In my view, consciousness has more to do with being alive than with being intelligent. We are conscious selves precisely because we are beast machines. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=153))
- I will make the case that experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=154))
- The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=155))
- our conscious experiences of the world and the self are forms of brain-based prediction – ‘controlled hallucinations’ – that arise with, through, and because of our living bodies. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=164))
- Looking back through the history of science, he identified three ‘strikes’ against the perceived self-importance of the human species, each marking a major scientific advance that was strongly resisted at the time. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=166))
- The first was by Copernicus, who showed with his heliocentric theory that the Earth rotates around the sun, and not the other way around. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=168))
- Next came Darwin, who revealed that we share common ancestry with all other living things, ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=170))
- Freud’s third strike against human exceptionalism was his own theory of the unconscious mind, which challenged the idea that our mental lives are under our conscious, rational control. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=171))
- The novelist Julian Barnes, in his meditation on mortality, puts it perfectly. When the end of consciousness comes there is nothing – really nothing – to be frightened of. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG1BXL5&location=179))
