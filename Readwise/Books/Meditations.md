## Highlights
- Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility [will]; to treat this person as he should be treated [action]; to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in [perception]. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=364))
- “Objective judgment … Unselfish action … Willing acceptance … of all external events.” ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=368))
- As for humans, our role is simply to live as best we can, making the most of what pleasures are available to us and insulating ourselves as far as possible from pain and anxiety. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=430))
- Things ordinary people are impressed by fall into the categories ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1479))
- The only thing that isn’t worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly. And be patient with those who don’t. ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1605))
- It doesn’t bother you that you weigh only x or y pounds and not three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1609))
- Do your best to convince them. But act on your own, if justice requires it. If met with force, then fall back on acceptance and peaceability. Use the setback to practice other virtues. Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you weren’t aiming to do the impossible. —Aiming to do what, then? To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accomplished. ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1611))
- Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions. ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1615))
- Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1618))
- To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1676))
- When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1685))
- Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them—that it would upset you to lose them. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1688))
- Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1750))
- Look at who they really are, the people whose approval you long for, and what their minds are really like. Then you won’t blame the ones who make mistakes they can’t help, and you won’t feel a need for their approval. You will have seen the sources of both—their judgments and their actions. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1761))
- pain is neither unbearable nor unending, ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1768))
- No one objects to what is useful to him. To be of use to others is natural. Then don’t object to what is useful to you—being of use. ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1795))
- For every action, ask: How does it affect me? Could I change my mind about it? But soon I’ll be dead, and the slate’s empty. So this is the only question: Is it the action of a responsible being, part of society, and subject to the same decrees as God? ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1810))
- When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your defining characteristic—what defines a human being—is to work with others. Even animals know how to sleep. And it’s the characteristic activity that’s the more natural one—more innate and more satisfying. ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1834))
- Apply them constantly, to everything that happens: Physics. Ethics. Logic. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1837))
- When you have to deal with someone, ask yourself: What does he mean by good and bad? If he thinks x or y about pleasure and pain (and what produces them), about fame and disgrace, about death and life, then it shouldn’t shock or surprise you when he does x or y. In fact, I’ll remind myself that he has no real choice. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1838))
- If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way. Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you? No pointless actions. ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1844))
- Stick to what’s in front of you—idea, action, utterance. ([Location 1857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1857))
- Joy for humans lies in human actions. Human actions: kindness to others, contempt for the senses, the interrogation of appearances, observation of nature and of events in nature. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1867))
- Three relationships:   i. with the body you inhabit;  ii. with the divine, the cause of everything in all things; iii. with the people around you. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1869))
- Either pain affects the body (which is the body’s problem) or it affects the soul. But the soul can choose not to be affected, preserving its own serenity, its own tranquillity. All our decisions, urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1872))
