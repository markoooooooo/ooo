## Highlights
- The same neurotic desperation that drives a person to settle for their ONE whether healthy or unhealthy is the same insecurity that paralyzes them from abandoning a damaging relationship ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=241))
- The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=258))
- There are some good Ones and there are some bad Ones, but there is no ONE. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=261))
- People subscribing to the myth would rather build a soul-mate, consequences be damned. So women will attempt to Build a better Beta, or tame down an Alpha, while men will attempt to turn a whore into a housewife, or vice versa. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=314))
- any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=323))
- One thing we all struggle to protect is a positive self-image. The more important the aspect of your self-image that’s challenged by the truth, the more likely you are to go into denial. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=416))
- So entrapped are we in our self-expectation and self-imposed limitations that we fail to see that we have always had the keys to our own prisons – we’re just scared shitless to use them. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=441))
- Instead we have the cart before the horse in a mad rush to get that all important pussy we’ve been deprived of for so long, by masking our deficit in real Power and understanding with rote memorized PUA techniques hoping that by practicing them they’ll turn into “natural game” and we’ll mature enough to initiate a lasting personal change. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=452))
- Six months into a comfortable familiarity and the thrill is gone, but in truth it’s the genuine desire that is gone. It’s often at this stage that a man will resort to negotiation. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=461))
- Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=469))
- She may be more sexually available to him, but the half-hearted experience is never the same as when they first met when there was no negotiation, just spontaneous desire for each other. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=471))
- The trick in provoking real desire is in keeping her ignorant of your intent to provoke it. Real desire is created by her thinking it’s something she wants, not something she has to do. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=487))
- This is the single greatest failing of average frustrated chumps; they vomit out everything about themselves, divulging the full truth of themselves to women in the mistaken belief that women desire that truth as a basis for qualifying for their intimacy. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=495))
- Learn this now: Women never want full disclosure. Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think she’s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination). ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=497))
- When a man overtly confirms his character, his story, his value, etc. for a woman, the mystery is dispelled and the biochemical rush she enjoyed from her imaginings, her suspicions, her self-confirmations about you are gone. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=499))
- Familiarity is anti-seductive. Nothing kills Game, organic passion and libido like comfortable familiarity. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=502))
- porn (as men use it) is a buffer against rejection. Porn doesn’t talk back, porn doesn’t need a few drinks to loosen up nor does porn require any social skills to produce rewards. It’s convenient, immediate, sexual release that requires nothing ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=683))
- Porn gives a guy his reward for free; a reward that should be her single best agency is rendered valueless when a man can get off to an infinite variety of sexual experience at the click of a mouse. It’s unlimited access to unlimited sexual availability without the stress of learning methods to earn it from women as a reward. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=687))
- The main reason for embracing rejection is that rejection is better than regret. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would’ve been? ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=694))
- Lastly, experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=698))
- teacher than getting burned by the stove. As a Man, you are going to face rejection in far more facets of your life than just dealing with a woman. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=700))
- Are you Alpha enough to take a rejection on the chin, smile and confidently come back for more? Or will you run, will you block yourself, will you hide with convenient buffers? ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=704))
- When we compensate, we improvise, we fake it till we make it; but who determines when we’ve stopped faking it? You do. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=750))
- The reason that so many guys get so bent about what defines an Alpha is usually because they don’t fit that general definition very well. So it’s a logical ego defense to make necessity a virtue and redefine it to better suit their own conditions. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=832))
- The worst beta schlub you know thinks he’s Alpha, because every woman he’s ever known has defined and affirmed for him that being Beta is what women want. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=837))
- To be Alpha implies that you necessarily rise above a certain degree of common mediocrity ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=846))
- women never doubt themselves on moral grounds for outshining their own competition in the sexual market place – they just do so covertly and with a polite smile, unburdened by ethical doubts. Hypergamy is its own excuse. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=849))
- “There are two types of artists; those who were born with a natural, innate gift for art, and those who lack that gift, but possess such a passion for art that it drives them to be good at it. The true masters are the artists that combine both natural talent and the drive that comes from a passion for it.” ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=900))
- feminization from a behavioral psychology perspective, is nothing less than a socialized effort in deliberate behavioral modification of men’s natural drives and predilections to better fit the feminine imperative. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=953))
- All of the Game theory, PUA techniques, even feminine-serving appeals to Man-Up! or any other effort designed to help men better mimic or internalize an Alpha behavioral or mind set, all of those efforts’ latent purpose is to return a man back to that primal Alpha energy the five-year-old you had in spades. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=971))
- The great unwashed masses in the pop culture narrative don’t recognize the legitimacy of Alpha influence as it is. To them it’s psychological manipulation, and to a calculated extent it really is, but the real question that nags them is why that manipulation is effective. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1015))
- This is the essence of the abundance mindset – confidence is derived from options. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1055))
- A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will manifest itself. A man without options becomes necessitous and this leads to a lack of confidence and a scarcity mentality. Necessitous men are never free. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1058))
- In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1062))
- The way to circumvent this dynamic is brutal honesty and a commitment to truthful, non-exclusivity with the plates you’re spinning. If you keep your options above board and are honest with any one girl and yourself about your choice to be non-exclusive, you not only remove the teeth from this convention, but you also reinforce yourself as a man with options (or at least perceived options). ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1112))
- Letting a woman know, or covertly perceive, that you wont be exclusive to her pushes your commodity level up and implies options and potential success she’ll compete with other women to be associated with. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1118))
- That said, Plate Theory is also, most definitely not, a license to be indiscriminate with women. Just because you can spin a plate doesn’t necessarily mean you should spin that plate. Some aren’t worth spinning and a man with options should have no reservation about letting one go for a better one or two. In fact a man ought to be more discriminating in this regard since it affords him the best available from the largest selection. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1120))
- Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled with a faithful loser. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1127))
- If you feel that you have something to lose with a particular girl, you’re no longer spinning plates – you’re thinking and approaching dating in terms of exclusivity. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1151))
- However, in practice, non-exclusivity has to be covert. It needs to be implied, not declared. ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1157))
- Initially I’d suggest doing exactly what most women have perfected for the better part of their lifetimes – internalize an intentional ambiguity with women. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1188))
- communicate your intent to be non-exclusive covertly. Never overtly tell a woman you’ve got other plates than her spinning. Allow her to discover this by your mannerisms, your behaviors, and definitely by your availability to her. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1193))
- Create value through scarcity, don’t be so available to her, but just enough to keep her interest and allow her mind to consider that maybe you have other options. Even when you don’t. Fomenting this anxiety is a very useful tool for you while you do get more plates to spin. Even the ambient confidence that comes from knowing you have a past, proven, ability to generate more sexual options for yourself will manifest itself in your personality and trigger this competition anxiety. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1196))
- At some point a woman will resort to overt communications when she’s run out of options in her covert communications tool set. This is the point the anxiety becomes unbearable and the need for security forces her to be overt. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1201))
- She becomes the broker for your options and sexuality, and you lose power, whereas before you were in control of your sexual availability. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1208))
- It’s not a numbers game, it’s a non-exclusivity game. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1220))
- The goal isn’t racking up as many women as humanly possible in order to sift through the throng and find that one little golden flower. In fact that’s the key to disaster. There is no Quality Woman, that’s an idealization. Some are better than others of course, but you don’t find the perfect woman, you make the perfect woman. There is no needle in the haystack – that is Scarcity / ONEitis thinking – the point is to mold yourself and any woman who you do exclusively end up with into your own frame. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1220))
- One of the biggest obstacles most men have with accepting the fundamentals of a positive masculine mindset is the attitude that personality is static and uncontrollable by them. A lot of this “that’s just how I am” mentality comes from this basic conditioning and needs to be addressed from the outset since this almost universally is an ego-investment on the part of a guy who’s probably emotionally distressed, confused and/or frustrated. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1248))
- Understand now that personality is ultimately what YOU determine it to be. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1253))
- You are most definitely not a blank slate, but you have the capacity to erase parts you don’t like or are unusable and rewrite new parts that you like and prove efficient. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1255))
- A truly powerful Man jealously guards his most precious resources; his independence and his ability to maneuver. In other words his options and his ability to exercise them. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1318))
- True power isn’t about controlling others, but the degree to which you control the course of your own life and your own choices. Commitment to anything always limits this. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1320))
- Play the field, do whatever, but do not commit even to a girlfriend. Rather, make a commitment to yourself, promise yourself you wont allow yourself to let emotionality and conditioned expectations of monogamy dictate what your goals will be or how you’ll achieve them. It’s called enlightened self-interest; you cannot help anyone until you’ve first helped yourself. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1344))
- Everything a woman does on a daily basis is colored by competition anxiety. Make up, clothing, shoes (God, the shoes!), indirect communications with men and women, social contrivances, comparing and evaluating dates and possible suitors, everything is borne from this competitive desire to achieve security with the best possible guy and make damn sure the girl next door doesn’t get him first. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1398))
- This anxiety is analogous to men’s consummate fear of rejection and all of the myriad rationales he’ll create and the Buffers he’ll devise to avoid it. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1401))
- Bear in mind that monogamy is a dictate of the feminine imperative. It is the social contract that the feminine ultimately needs in order to quell a constant desire for security in a very chaotic world. When you are predisposed to monogamy-as-goal thinking, or trying to break yourself of this, understand that this is a tool of the feminine imperative. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1402))
- There is an understandable confusion for guys in this respect. On one hand women present a constant facade that the fear of being perceived as a slut (i.e. concurrently fucking more than one guy at a time) is primary to their self-respect and respectability. However, this has to be tempered with the desire (both biological and psychological) to experience a variety of men in order to ensure the security/provisioning from the best among them. ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1420))
- So in order to facilitate this women must practice a kind of calculated hypocrisy that is socially reinforced by the gender as a whole as well as some men (usually those so optionless as to excuse the behavior in order to get to her sexuality, or guys so conditioned that they overlook it as normal). It is socially acceptable for a woman to blatantly spin plates. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1424))
- In all social situations the default is to side with the feminine, the “weaker sex” – women, from sympathy or empathy, and men, from a desire to eventually become intimate with them. ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1440))
- For a woman to say another woman is a “slut” translates into an overt betrayal of this unspoken social contrivance. Essentially she’s saying, “the rules are that women require commitment for sex, but here’s one who’ll never be worthy of any guy’s commitment because she wont play by the rules you suckers think she will.” ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1464))
- Gentlemen, as I’m fond of saying, women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1475))
- The girl who bangs the hot guy at the foam party in Cancun on Spring Break within 5 minutes of meeting him is the same girl who wants you to believe that they’ll only fuck one guy at a time and then after commitment. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1476))
- All women are sexual, you just need to be the right guy at the right time for the job. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1478))
- Essentially a shit-test is used by women to determine one, or a combination of these factors: a.) Confidence – first and foremost b.) Options – is this guy really into me because I’m ‘special’ or am I his only option? c.) Security – is this guy capable of providing me with long term security? ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1495))
- the only time a man should even contemplate monogamy is after experiencing abundance. ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1509))
- A belief that women infallibly and consciously recognize what they want, and honestly convey this to them, irrespective of behaviors that contradict this. Uses deductive reasoning in determining intent and bases female motivations on statements rather than objectively observing behavior. Believes women’s natural propensity is for rational rather than emotional thought. ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1568))
- Women have boyfriends and girlfriends. If you’re not fucking her, you’re her girlfriend. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1599))
- Virtually all guys who get to the point of a LJBF rejection come to it because they fall in line with some variation of what I call a Sniper Mentality. They patiently wait for their one target, to the exception of all others, constantly attempting to prove their quality in doing so – meaning they emphasize a comfort level and try to be friends before lovers. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1621))
- In essence they believe that desexualizing themselves will make them more attractive (by virtue of not being like “other guys”) because they’ve bought into the idea that a woman must be comfortable with them first before they initiate intimacy. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1624))
- The problem with this process is that it bypasses essential stages of attraction and the necessary discomfort and sexual tension necessary for intimacy, and proceeds directly to a warm familiar, comfortable, (and ultimately anti-seductive) rapport, the exact opposite of arousal. If you think about this in terms of sex, this is the stage right after climax when she wants to cuddle, spoon and be wrapped up in her nice, secure oxytocin induced comfort. This is the opposite of the testosterone fueled, sweaty, anxious and uncomfortable stage of arousal and intercourse before that release. ([Location 1628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1628))
- By not accepting a LJBF you emphatically make known that you are good at confrontation, you have an understanding of her motives and you’re confident enough in yourself to make it known. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1673))
- Rejection is better than Regret. ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1712))
- It’s just this overt masculine interactive nature that women are only too ready to exploit. ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1790))
- The obvious example is of course “shaming” and the “do-the-right-thing” social contract. In fact to be a “Man” has become synonymous with living up to a feminine imperative that’s cleverly disguised as masculine Honor. It’s not that women created Honor, but rather that they’ve recreated it to serve their purpose. ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1795))
- The expectation to assume the responsibilities of being a man (Man Up) while at the same time denigrating asserting masculinity as a positive (Shut Up). What ever aspect of maleness that serves the feminine purpose is a man’s masculine responsibility, yet any aspect that disagrees with feminine primacy is labeled Patriarchy, ‘Male Privilege’ or Misogyny. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1809))
- “Every time a man is being nice to you, he’s offering dick. That’s all it is. ‘Uh, can I get that for ya? How ’bout some dick? Can I help you with that? Can I help you with some dick? Do you need some dick?’ ” – Chris Rock ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1830))
- The fundamental flaw of the Savior Schema (a.k.a. “Cap’n Save a Ho) is that it is essentially negotiated intimacy, and negotiated intimacy is never genuine. You can fix a woman’s flat tire, help her out of a financial jam, fix her a nice lasagna, give her the perfect shoulder to cry on, babysit her kids and listen to her drone on for hours on the phone, and she’ll still go fuck her outlaw biker boyfriend because her intimacy with him is genuine, unnegotiated, unobligated desire. She wants to have sex with him, she doesn’t owe him sex. ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1843))
- What AFCs fail to understand is that all the financial, emotional, dependable support you could possibly offer a woman is no substitute for raw, unmitigated, chemical desire. Some of the most irresponsible, unreliable, poverty level washouts often get more sex than any dutiful, loyal AFC suffering from a Savior Schema, because there is no obligation. ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1848))
- Once you strip away the heady fantasies of soul-mates and expectations of ‘happily ever afters”, and replace it with a more practical understanding based on reasonably reliable, empirical, explanations, what you’re left with looks a lot like nihilism. Even for the most staunch realists among the ‘community’ there’s still a desire to want to apply, however slightly, some kind of magical thinking to the process of connecting with another human being. For other Men it may be some esoteric desire to cast their association in terms of honor, integrity or respect – for women it comes as idealization or predestination. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1973))
- We know a hormone like oxytocin induces feelings of trust and promotes nurturing. We know that the endorphin / dopamine profile associated with feelings of infatuation, lust and love is chemically similar to that of heroine. Poof! There goes the magic. ([Location 1980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=1980))
- Women want to be told “No”, and constantly test a man’s resolve to say this to her (a.k.a. shit testing) in order to affirm that she’s made the right choice (even in marriage) of a guy who’ll put his sexual impulse (knowing full-well how powerful it is with men) on hold to stick to his own self-interest, beliefs and ambitions. ([Location 2087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2087))
- “Self-love is not so great a sin as self-neglect.” - Henry V ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2096))
- Humility is an admirable quality too, don’t get me wrong, but humility is only genuine when you’re confident of your own abilities. It takes a humble Man to walk away from a fight that he knows he could win, but chooses not to engage in. Generally humility is only self-gratifying, because only rarely will others appreciate it as humility ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2099))
- Pride often appears arrogant because people of lesser accomplishments become envious, and people of better accomplishments think less of them than you do. It’s very important not to appear too perfect, but it’s equally important not to seem spineless. ([Location 2103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2103))
- Guys don’t search out community forums or blogs like mine because they’re getting too much pussy. They search it out on Google because what they’ve been doing isn’t producing the results they want. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2113))
- Remember this, PUA skills are tools, and valuable ones, but adopting a positive masculine mindset prepares you for more. An AFC needs to divorce himself from deep set social and psychological schema – he needs to unlearn the self-delusions that a lifetime has conditioned him to internalize into his personality.

- This is what I mean by the process; you’re not going to be bulletproof and pass every shit-test ever thrown at you, but be encouraged in knowing that because of your new awareness you’ll learn from what you do wrong and adjust for the next time. There is no grand arrival moment when you know you’ve got it all down, you’re an Alpha, or if you don’t like that term, there really is no definitive point at which you’ve fully internalized Game.

- It’s easy to go emotionally cold as a result of being burned, it’s a much taller order to tamp that emotionality back into check when you’re really feeling good about it. Our emotions make us human and humane. It’s important to embrace that as essential to the human experience, but equally important is to see how easily it’s used against you. You need to unlearn the reasons why you’re so easily emotional. ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2247))
- You have to unlearn the old behaviors and condition new ones in order to right your course.

- Changing your mind about yourself is the first step. This is actually the most difficult step for guys because most don’t want to believe they need to internalize a new way of thinking about themselves. Lethargy, for the most part, can be the primary reason most guys don’t want to change. It’s far easier to create rationales for oneself as to why they are happy in their present condition than it is to critically confront and initiate real change.

- were no object, to which I answered, time. Power isn’t financial resources, status or influence over others; power is the degree over which you control your own life, and right now, if I’ve just described you, you are powerful.

([Location 2385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2385))
- Women want to ‘want’ their men. Women want a Man who other men want to be, and other women want to fuck. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2396))
- She doesn’t want a slave to her intimacy since this puts her in the masculine role. Rather, she wants a decisive mature man who has the confidence to put her off, to tell her ‘No’, in favor of his ambition and passions as this serves two purposes. First, it sets his frame and his direction as the one of authority, and his development as the primary; the results of which she and her potential children will benefit from. Secondly, it puts her into a position of chasing after him – essentially his legitimate ambitions and passions become the ‘other woman’ with which she must compete for his attention. ([Location 2397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2397))
- All of this is limited by a man’s attitude towards the opposite sex. Women are dream killers. Not because they have an agenda to be so, but because men will all too willingly sacrifice their ambitions for a steady supply of pussy and the responsibilities that women attach to this. ([Location 2409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2409))
- It is to say don’t consider monogamy until you are mature enough to understand it’s limiting effects and you’ve achieved a degree of success to your own satisfaction according to your ambitions and passions. It is also to say that women should compliment and support your plans for your own life. ([Location 2413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2413))

- Most newly Game-aware men who are comfortable enough to venture using Peacocking don’t realize that a little goes a long way. Your Game isn’t peacocking, it’s just the flashy lure to get the fish to strike. It’s up to you to play the fish once it’s hooked. ([Location 2460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2460))
- While a broader understanding of hypergamy and Game make for useful tools for enlightened single men, the Game-accepting Beta plug-in will still see it strictly as a means to satisfying the female imperative – long-term provisional monogamy. Any deviation from this narrative, any guy using Game for personal gain, personal pleasure or to enact his own sexual strategy is guilty of crimes against (feminized) society. Since the societal Greater Good has been defined by the feminine imperative, anything counter to it is definitively evil, counterproductive, anti-social and manipulative sociopathy. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2532))
- It is not that you’re hopeless, it’s that you lack the insight at this point to see that you can create hope in a new system – one in which you have more direct control over. ([Location 2542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2542))
- There are no “Dark Arts”, this is simply one last desperate effort of the feminine imperative to drag you back into the Matrix. There is only Game and the degree to which you accept it and are comfortable in using it in the context that you define. ([Location 2544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2544))
- Power is neither good nor evil, it simply is, and your capacity to use power, your comfort in using it, doesn’t invalidate the principles of power. Likewise, your discomfort or inability to accept those principles does not excuse you from the consequence of having that power used upon you. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2554))
- Not an emancipation from women, but an emancipation from their imperative’s conditioning and purpose. Not a ‘men going their own way’ negligence of women in the hope that they’ll come around to behaving as men would like after being given no other choice, but a true Game driven emancipation from the control that fem-centrism has maintained for so long. ([Location 2699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2699))
- Women in marriage and LTRs want to push past that nagging hypergamic competition anxiety; they want security, not just financial, but emotional, and the security that comes from a locked in commitment in knowing they are the only source of sex & intimacy for their spouse/ partner. ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2715))
- Sex is now a tool. In her uncommitted sex life it was a tool for qualification; in her LTR life it’s a tool for compliance. ([Location 2729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2729))
- You must find ways to, subtly, return back to the state of competition anxiety she had in the beginning. I emphasize subtly, because, as with most everything else female, doing so overtly will be met with hostility, resentment and at best, obligated compliance. ([Location 2744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2744))
- To get more (any?) sex, to retain the frame, to inspire more respect in her, you must disengage from her. That doesn’t mean becoming arrogantly aloof, or sulking like a child, or becoming an instant asshole; those are overt signs and methods. What is needed is incremental reassertion of yourself as the primary AND that her sexual agency, while still welcomed, is not a motivator for your own decisions. ([Location 2746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2746))
- They fail to understand that a woman’s imagination is the most powerful tool in the Don Juan toolbox. ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2751))

- The better you make yourself the more authority you command, the more you abdicate to her the less authority (and respect) you command. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2771))
- Women need to be told “NO”, in fact they want you to tell them “NO”, especially in light of the 800 pound gorilla in the room – her sexual agency. ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2773))
- She wants to be told “NO” in spite of you knowing she’s going to hold out on you. This is the ultimate repudiation of her sexual agency – “if he says “NO” with the foreknowledge that he knows he wont be getting any, my sexual powers are devalued.” If her sexual agency is called into question it leaves room for doubt and opens the door once again for competition anxiety to creep back in. ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2777))
- Nothing is as simultaneously fear inspiring and arousing for women as a Man she suspects is self-aware of his own value. ([Location 2783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2783))
- This is precisely why a feminized culture must continually confuse him, continually inspire doubt and humiliate him; feminization can’t afford men knowing their true value and potential. ([Location 2784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2784))
- In the end, who cares if you don’t get laid for a week? It’s well worth the price for increasing her respect for you as a commodity, and increasingly, an authority. If you want to maintain that anxiety, you must perpetuate yourself as being a commodity women will compete for, even (especially) in the confines of committed monogamy.

- The hardest distinction the uninitiated have with the JBY (just be yourself) dynamic is that personality is malleable. Personality is always in flux. The person you are today isn’t who you were 2 years ago, nor the person you’ll be 2 years from now. There are traits and characteristics we may carry with us for a lifetime, but even these are subject to change depending upon circumstance. You define what being yourself is at any given moment and it’s relative to your personal conditions and environment. ([Location 2912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2912))
- women claim to want honesty from men, but no woman wants full disclosure. In a general sense I advise this because it serves to sustain a Man’s aura of mystery, only to be progressively discovered by women with the appropriate levels of interest and responsiveness to men. However, another reason to remain deliberately ambiguous is to defuse the JBY dynamic that women assume would be a man’s default psychology. ([Location 2950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2950))
- Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions— your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life. ([Location 2972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=2972))
- It’s far easier to believe that the world should change for you than to accept the truth that you need to improve yourself to get the things you want. It’s the lazy man’s path to disqualify or cheapen things that he desperately wants, but lacks the motivation to change himself to get. ([Location 3037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3037))
- Most people resist becoming what they hate, even if it’s a change for the better. ([Location 3042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3042))
- Allow me to go on record as viewing these ideas as mindsets whereas terms such as being an AFC or Alpha are really states of being. For instance, a contextual Alpha can be the master of his professional realm and still be an AFC with regards to women. A Beta male can still be as wealthy and astute in status as his conditions and fortune have placed him in (often by circumstance). ([Location 3050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3050))
- The fallacy in this of course is the presumption that like should attract like. Beta men fail to understand that opposites attract, and barring the notable exceptions, most women don’t want to marry other women, least of all a carbon copy of themselves. ([Location 3082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3082))
- De-sexualization as Game is one of the primary mistakes Betas make. ([Location 3139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3139))
- The myth is one that women need to be comfortable with a guy in order to sleep with him, so men will actively de-sexualize themselves in order to comply. However, all indications point to a need for sexual anxiety and tension in arousal to prompt sexual intercourse. ([Location 3185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3185))
- Sigmund Freud once said, “all energy is sexual”, meaning that subliminally we will redirect our motivation for ungratified sexual impulse to other endeavors. Thus it’s men, being the sex with the highest amount of libido inducing testosterone, who must look for far more outlets to transfer this motivation to than women. So is it any real surprise that it’s historically Men who’ve primarily been the empire builders, the conquerors, the creators, and destroyers who’ve (for better or worse) moved humanity the most significantly? Masturbation defuses this impulse. It kills that drive, or at least sublimates it. ([Location 3198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3198))

- As a behaviorist, I’m a firm believer in the psychological principal that the only way to determine genuine motivation and/or intent is to observe the behavior of an individual. All one need do is compare behavior and the results of it to correlate intent. A woman will communicate vast wealths of information and truths to a man if he’s only willing to accept her behavior, not exclusively her words, as the benchmark for what she’s relating. ([Location 3380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3380))
- We get frustrated because women communicate differently than we do. Women communicate covertly, men communicate overtly. Men convey information, women convey feeling. In relating information, men prioritize content, women prioritize context. ([Location 3384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3384))
- Women prefer to fight in the psychological, whereas boys fight in the physical. Within their own peer group, little girls fight for dominance with the threat of ostracization from the group. “I wont be your friend anymore if,..” is just as much a threat to a girl as “I’m gonna punch you in the face if,..” is to a boy. ([Location 3432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=3432))
- I’ve also written volumes about the all-risk proposition of marriage for men, and women’s utter inability to appreciate the all-risk sacrifices men assume in committing to marriage. So it should be obvious that under such conditions if a man chooses to entertain a lifestyle of marriage the only acceptable condition is that it be within his frame and his terms. And this, gentlemen, requires not only an internalized commitment to Game itself, but an understanding of, and an internalization of a much tighter Game than would be necessary in single-man-sex-life.

- Dumping a girl (or getting dumped) when single may be an emotional ordeal for some guys, but the decay of a marriage and the financial, familial and emotional consequences for lacking Game in marriage is a punishment that will make a single man’s break up tears seem like a blessing. Tight relationship Game means much more than just getting your wife to fuck you more regularly after the honeymoon.

- Women despise a man who needs to be told to be dominant, told to be confident, told to be anything they have on their list of prerequisites for their intimacy. Overtly relating this to a guy entirely defeats his credibility as a genuinely dominant male. The guy she wants to fuck is dominant because that’s ‘the way he is’ instead of who she had to tell him to be.

- “IF SHE’D JUST TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO TO MAKE HER LOVE ME I’D DO IT!” not realizing that their very verbalization of that, and a belief in open, rational communication, is the very thing that’s killing (or killed) their woman’s desire for him.

- A cardinal truth of the universe is that genuine desire cannot be negotiated.

- What she wants, what her hypergamy wants confirmation of, can never be explicated, it can only be demonstrated.

- Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think she’s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination). When you blurt out your ‘feelings’ or overtly make known your optionless status, regardless of the context or the nobility of your intent, all you do is deny her this satisfaction. And like an easily distracted child she discards you for another, more entertaining, toy that holds some kind of mystery or puzzle for her figure out.

- This is what makes the ‘red pill’ so hard to swallow; men truly want the fantasy, the romanticism and love, in the context girl-world presents it to them for so long, to really exist for them. This is what makes believing women’s individualized words, rather than their globalized behaviors, so seductive for men – even for Men who’ve become selfaware in the feminine Matrix.

- Becoming Game-aware teaches Men that the medium is the message, but to varying degrees Men still want to believe that women are completely self-honest, rational agents, and completely cognizant of their internal motivations. Eventually applied behaviorism puts the truth to this deception, but it’s very hard to let go of that want for an easier answer.

- This is a major obstacle in transitioning from AFC to positive masculinity. AFCs all initially laugh at PUA technique (Cocky & Funny, Peacocking, Neg Hits, etc.) because they carry the potential of being perceived as ‘shallow’.

Essentially they are serving two masters in this: they want the freedom to pursue a short term sexual opportunity (as well as the freedom from social repercussions as a result) and also the prudence to filter for a man willing to assume the responsibilities of parental investment and provisioning.

- Hypergamy doesn’t care if you’re bitter. ([Location 4309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4309))
- As if all of the investment, emotional, physical, financial, familial, etc. would be rationally appreciated as a buffer against hypergamy. The reason for their shock and disbelief is that their mental state originates in the assumption that women are perfectly rational agents and should take all of their efforts, all of their personal strengths, all of the involvement in their women’s lives into account before trading up to a better prospective male. There is a prevailing belief that all of their merits, if sufficient, should be proof against her hypergamous considerations. ([Location 4315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4315))
- This dynamic is exactly the reason the surrogate boyfriend, the perfect nice guy orbiter who’s invested so much into identifying with his target, gets so enraged when his dream girl opts for the hot asshole jerk. She’s not making a logical decision based upon his invested relational equity. Quite the opposite; she’s empirically proving for him that his equity is worthless by rewarding the hot jerk – who had essentially no equity – with her sex and intimacy. He doesn’t understand that hypergamy doesn’t care about relational equity. ([Location 4327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4327))
- The limbic influence hypergamy has over women’s decision making processes is a constant subroutine playing in the background. The short answer is this is a mistaken belief that healthy relationships can be rooted in negotiated desire (which is also called ‘obligated desire’ in the real world). ([Location 4341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4341))
- It is a far healthier approach to accept the laws of power, the laws of Game, red pill awareness, Hypergamy, etc. and fashion a life around an understanding of them than to convince oneself that they are an exception to them. ([Location 4548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4548))
- Frame is everything. Always be aware of the subconscious balance of who’s frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are. ([Location 4568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4568))
- Most Game incongruities develop around a guy’s inability to establish frame and opting in to a woman’s frame. What’s ironic is that on a base level, we understand frame imbalances instinctively. If you feel like you’re being led on, or being made to wait for sex, you’re operating in her frame. Are you in the ‘friend-zone’ or did you accept an LJBF rejection? You’re in her frame. ([Location 4598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4598))
- Ideally, you want a woman to enter your reality. Her genuine (unnegotiated) desire for you hinges upon you covertly establishing this narrative for her. Famous men, men with conspicuous affluence and status, and men with overwhelming social proof have very little difficulty in establishing frame – they can’t help but establish frame in a very overt fashion. ([Location 4602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4602))
- It is vital to the health of any LTR that a man establish his frame as the basis of their living together before any formal commitment is recognized. As I stated in the beginning, frame will be fluid and conditions will influence the balance, but the overall theme of your relationship needs to be led and molded by you. ([Location 4628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4628))

- Any woman who makes you wait for sex, or by her actions implies she is making you wait for sex; the sex is NEVER worth the wait. ([Location 4688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4688))
- Sexuality is spontaneous chemical reaction between two parties, not a process of negotiation. It’s sex first, then relationship, not the other way around. A woman who wants to fuck you will find a way to fuck you. ([Location 4692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4692))
- If she’s perceiving your value as high as it should be, she wont hesitate longer than a few dates to become sexual – and she certainly wont tell you she’s making you wait. Hypergamy doesn’t afford a woman much waiting time with a Man she sees as superior stock. ([Location 4719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4719))
- If a woman, point blank says, “I’m not having sex with you until X,Y, and Z happens”, what is her medium telling you?

- Hypergamy seeks its own level, it wants the best commodity it’s capable of attracting and maintaining. Hypergamy is above all, practical, and thus Men, the True Romantics must be pragmatists to enact their own sexual strategy. ([Location 4787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4787))

- Men are the romantics forced to be the realists, while women are the realists using romanticisms to effect their imperatives (hypergamy). ([Location 4956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4956))
- Women are utterly incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved. In its simplicity this speaks volumes about the condition of Men. It accurately expresses a pervasive nihilism that Men must either confront and accept, or be driven insane in denial for the rest of their lives when they fail to come to terms with the disillusionment. ([Location 4959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4959))
- Women are incapable of loving men in a way that a man idealizes is possible, in a way he thinks she should be capable of. In the same respect that women cannot appreciate the sacrifices men are expected to make in order to facilitate their imperatives, women can’t actualize how a man would have himself loved by her. It is not the natural state of women, and the moment he attempts to explain his ideal love, that’s the point at which his idealization becomes her obligation. ([Location 4962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4962))
- Our girlfriends, our wives, daughters and even our mothers are all incapable of this idealized love. As nice as it would be to relax, trust and be vulnerable, upfront, rational and open, the great abyss is still the lack of any capacity for women to love Men as Men would like them to. ([Location 4967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4967))
- It’s much healthier to accept that it isn’t possible and live within that framework. If she’s there, she’s there, if not, oh well. She’s not incapable of love in the way she defines it, she’s incapable of love as you would have it. ([Location 4973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4973))
- Men have been, and should be, the more dominant gender, not because of some imagined divine right or physical prowess, but because on some rudimentary psychological level we ought to realized that a woman’s love is contingent upon our capacity to maintain that love in spite of a woman’s hypergamy. By order of degrees, hypergamy will define who a woman loves and who she will not, depending upon her own opportunities and capacity to attract it. ([Location 4978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=4978))
- So he finds a woman, who says and shows him that she loves him, but not in the manner he’s had all this time in his head. Her love is based on hypergamic qualifications, performance, and is far more conditional than what he’d been led to believe, or convinced himself, love should be between them. Her love seems duplicitous, ambiguous, and seemingly, too easily lost in comparison to what he’d been taught for so long is how a woman would love him when he found her. ([Location 5014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5014))
- The biggest hurdle isn’t so much in women recognizing this, but rather in men recognizing it themselves. So, hypothetically, yes you could, but the problem then becomes one of the genuineness of that desire. Love, like desire, is only legitimate when it’s uncoerced and unobligated. Men believe in love for the sake of love, women love opportunistically. It’s not that either subscribe to unconditional love, it’s that both gender’s conditions for love differ. ([Location 5033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5033))
- It is always time and effort better spent developing relations with new, fresh, prospective women than it will ever be in attempting to reconstruct a failed relationship. ([Location 5040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5040))
- the feminine imperative enlisted the aid of the men themselves and created self-perpetuated, self-internalized social doctrines for men to comply with in order to exist in a feminine defined society. The concept of leagues is just one of these doctrines. Your self-doubt about your worthiness of a woman’s intimacy stems from a preconditioned idea that ‘you’re out of her league’. The booster club optimist idea that “if you think you can’t, you’re right” is true, and boundless enthusiasm may overcome some obstacles, but to address the source of the disease it’s more important to ask yourself why you’ve been taught to think you can’t. ([Location 5088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5088))
- A lot of approach anxiety comes from your own self-impression – Am I smooth, hot, affluent, funny, confident, interesting, decisive, well-dressed enough to earn an HB 9′s attention? How about an HB 6? Our great danger is not that we aim too high and fail, but that we aim too low and succeed. ([Location 5094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5094))
- I’m not debating the legitimacy of the evaluative standards of the sexual market place – it’s a harsh, often cruel reality – what I’m really trying to do is open your eyes as to why you believe you’re only meritorious of an HB 7. Looks count for a lot, as does Game, affluence, personality, talent, etc. but is your self-estimation accurate, or are you a voluntary participant in your own self-devaluation in the SMP courtesy of the leagues mentality the feminine imperative would have you believe? ([Location 5097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5097))
- Irrational self-confidence is a good start to circumventing and unlearning the concept of leagues; unlearning this conditioning being the operative goal. The Game-aware Man can actually use the concept of leagues to his advantage with enough guile. ([Location 5125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5125))
- When you approach a woman without regard to a league mentality or even a Zen-like obliviousness to it (ala Corey Worthington, the Alpha Buddha), you send the message that there’s more to you than a feminine reality can control. ([Location 5128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5128))
- It’s exactly this disregard for the influence of the feminine imperative that makes the Alpha attractive; he’s unaware of, or indifferent to the rules his conditioning should have taught him earlier. ([Location 5129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5129))
- Doubt is a very powerful tool, in fact the very concept of leagues is founded upon men’s self-doubt. Turn that tool to your advantage by disregarding women’s social convention of leagues. ([Location 5133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5133))
- Never seriously self-deprecate with a woman you intend to be intimate with. ([Location 5138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5138))
- Never appeal to a woman’s sympathies. Her sympathies are given by her own volition, never when they are begged for – women despise the obligation of sympathy. Nothing kills arousal like pity. Even if you don’t seriously consider yourself pathetic, it never serves your best interest to paint yourself as pathetic. Self-depreciation is a misguided tool for the AFC, and not something that would even occur to an Alpha. ([Location 5166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5166))
- Nothing endears a Man more to a woman than to think only she can break through your shell and get you to find humor in yourself. ([Location 5172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5172))
- It’s not the “ha ha, look I slipped on a banana peel” sense of deprecation, it’s the “I’m a complete douche, but really I’m worth the effort” apologetic sense of deprecation. There is a marked difference between being pathetic and being able to laugh at yourself in good faith. ([Location 5174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5174))
- Humility is a virtue (up to a point), but it’s simply not a virtue that a woman you’re interested in will ever appreciate in the manner you think they will, and in fact often conveys the opposite intent. Virtuous humility is no substitute for self-confidence. ([Location 5178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5178))
- Women want a competent, confident, decisive Man from the outset, not one who’s self-image is that of a “complete douche” or even a partial douche. The stereotype of the quirky, but lovable guy who bumbles his way into a woman’s heart may work for romantic comedies, but not in the real world. ([Location 5191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5191))
- All of this is not to say that it’s wrong to recognize your own weaknesses and understanding when you’re in the wrong. It’s simply how you go about addressing it that’s the point. There are plenty of ways to assume the responsibilities of fault that aren’t self-depreciating. ([Location 5196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5196))
- The easiest way is to always adopt the attitude that you’re ‘getting better all the time’. This mentality fosters confidence and projects ambition, whereas self-depreciation shoves your nose in the dog shit and says “please love me anyway?” ([Location 5198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5198))

- Now the real question is, why would such a popular myth be such a useful social convention? Think about it. It sexualizes women, while not making them outright sluts. They can avoid the stigma of promiscuity while presenting the fantasy that they are secretly “more sexual” than they are “allowed” to be, if only they could meet a man skilled enough to bring this out in them.

- From the moment we’re born we realize love is conditional, but we want for it to be unconditional; our idealized state is unconditional love. To be a Man is to perform, to excel, to be the one for whom affections are freely given in appreciation and adoration. On a base level it’s this constant striving for that idealized love-state that helps us become more than we started as, but it comes at the cost of a misguided belief that a woman is capable of, much less willing to love us as we think is possible.

- We want to relax. We want to be open and honest. We want to have a safe haven in which struggle has no place, where we gain strength and rest instead of having it pulled from us. We want to stop being on guard all the time, and have a chance to simply be with someone who can understand our basic humanity without begrudging it. To stop fighting, to stop playing the game, just for a while. We want to, so badly. If we do, we soon are no longer able to.

- men dislike the notion of their easy ‘disposability’ because of that same inconsistency in gender concepts of love.

- Everything a man experiences, every social conditioning he receives from the earliest age, every accepted social norm and every expectation of him to qualify as the definition of a mature adult Man in contemporary society is designed to serve a female imperative.

- Some will argue that it hasn’t always been thus, and that in certain eras woman have been reduced to property like cattle. While that may have some merit I would argue that the perpetuation of this notion better serves the new feminine reality in promoting a need for recognition of victim status and thus a need for restitution.

- Women are every bit as calculating as men, in fact more so I’d argue because they have the mystique to hide a multitude of sins behind.

- Women’s sexual strategy is very schizophrenic – ideally women want a Man that other women want to fuck, but in order to assess his sexual market value to other women he’s got to have exercisable options for her to compete against, or at least display indirect social proof to that effect. So, she needs to limit his options while simultaneously determining he has those options. ([Location 5916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5916))
- This internal conflict between a want for security and provisioning, and a need for the ‘gina tingles that only the excitement indignation, drama and Alpha dominance can stimulate is the fundamental root for women’s shit tests. ([Location 5919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5919))
- Essentially a shit test is used by women to determine one, or a combination of these factors: a.) Confidence – first and foremost b.) Options – is this guy really into me because I’m ‘special’ or am I his only option? c.) Security – is this guy capable of providing me with long term security? Women’s shit testing is a psychologically evolved, hard-wired survival mechanism. Women will shit test men as autonomously and subconsciously as a men will stare at a woman’s big boobs. They cannot help it, and often enough, just like men staring at a nice rack or a great ass, even when they’re aware of doing it they’ll still do it. Men want to verify sexual availability to the same degree women want to verify a masculine dominance / confidence. ([Location 5922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5922))
- For a woman, to encounter a man with a healthy awareness of his own value to women, this constitutes a threat. Here is a man for whom’s attention women will demonstrably compete for, and he knows this. This is the most basic affront to the feminine imperative; to be unplugged, of high sexual market value and to derive a sense of confidence from being consciously aware of it. ([Location 5930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5930))
- she wants the Alpha dominance of a confident Man, but not so confident that he can exercise his options with other women well enough to make an accurate estimation of her own SMV. Ambiguity in men’s assessment of a woman’s true sexual market value is the primary tool of the feminine imperative.

- The same characteristics that give him his confidence and acknowledged sense of worth are exactly the same things that women want to be associated with. Even the most controlling, domineering wife still wants to tell her friends that the AFC she married is a “real Man”, and even after privately berating him, will defend him as such because anything less is a reflection on her own self-image. She wants to be with a Man that other men want to be, and other women want to fuck, because it confirms for her that she’s of an equal or higher value to attract and be associated with such a Man.

- The best social contrivances are inconspicuous and rarely questioned because they’ve been learned without having been formally taught. This is why I think encouraging men not to bother trying to understand women is in itself a social convention. Don’t look at that man behind the curtain, just accept it for what it is, enjoy the show, you’re better off that way, the Mighty Oz has spoken.

- This is the threat that Game represents to the feminine imperative. Widely shared, objective assessments of Men’s SMV and how it develops is the antithesis of the female sexual strategy. Women’s greatest fear is that they could become the ‘selected’ instead of the ‘selectors’. ([Location 5965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5965))
- Masculinity has been redefined by people (men and women) who have no concept of what its original definition was. The behaviors and characteristics that constitute what is uniquely masculine aren’t being challenged; they’ve been redefined to fit the purposes of an agenda. In 1905 no one wrote articles on how to “be a man” or bothered to analyze the fundamentals of masculinity. Men knew from their socialization what was masculine and women responded to it. ([Location 5983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5983))
- Traditionally, women define what is masculine and men define what is feminine. The characteristics that made a man desirable were ones that presented the opposite to what men similarly found desirable in femininity. Men and their biology defines what in the feminine that arouses them, women react to this and behave accordingly (knowingly or not).

- In expecting women to be just as masculine as men, while simultaneously expecting them to still embody a feminine ideal, not only does this puts undue, unrealistic ideals upon them, but also devalues the merits of their own femininity. That’s not to say, given this new gender dynamic, that women are discouraged from claiming their femininity in addition to their masculinity. On the contrary they’re encouraged to “handle their business as well as any man” and “still be a sexy, vivacious woman” every man should want. Yet in opposition to this post-modern gender dynamic, men are not encouraged to embrace their masculine side We are told to “man up” for sure, and yet our masculinity (as we define it) is a flaw; we’re poisoned by our testosterone. Our higher aspiration ought to be becoming more feminized, sensitive, emotional, empathetic, nurturing, etc,.. We should “feel comfortable waxing our legs” stripping away the hair that is the result of our poisoning testosterone. Interestingly enough there are few cries in society to have women cultivate their leg or armpit hair. ([Location 5999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FK901R8&location=5999))
