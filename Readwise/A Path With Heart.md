- While the promise of attaining such states can come true, and while these states do represent the teachings, in one sense, they are also one of the advertising techniques of the spiritual trade. They are not the goal of spiritual life. In the end, spiritual life is not a process of seeking or gaining some extraordinary condition or special powers. In fact, such seeking can take us away from ourselves. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=304))
- Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question. This question is one that only a very old man asks. My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it. Now I do understand it. I will tell you what it is: Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good. If it doesn’t, it is of no use. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=311))
- Now cast your memory back across your whole life and bring to mind two good deeds that you have done, two things that you did that were good. They need not be grandiose; let whatever wants to arise show itself. In picturing and remembering these good deeds, also become aware of how these memories affect your consciousness, how they transform the feelings and state of the heart and mind, as you see them. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=336))
- The things that matter most in our lives are not fantastic or grand. They are the moments when we touch one another, when we are there in the most attentive or caring way. This simple and profound intimacy is the love that we all long for. These moments of touching and being touched can become a foundation for a path with heart, and they take place in the most immediate and direct way. Mother Teresa put it like this: “In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.” ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=351))
- Letting go and moving through life from one change to another brings the maturing of our spiritual being. In the end we discover that to love and let go can be the same thing. Both ways do not seek to possess. Both allow us to touch each moment of this changing life and allow us to be there fully for whatever arises next. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=381))
- To love fully and live well requires us to recognize finally that we do not possess or own anything—our homes, our cars, our loved ones, not even our own body. Spiritual joy and wisdom do not come through possession but rather through our capacity to open, to love more fully, and to move and be free in life. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=388))
- “The trouble with you is that you think you have time.” ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=391))
- The truth is what one really needs is not Nobel laureates but love. How do you think one gets to be a Nobel laureate? Wanting love, that’s how. Wanting it so bad one works all the time and ends up a Nobel laureate. It’s a consolation prize. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=435))
- What matters is how we live. This is why it is so difficult and so important to ask this questions of ourselves: “Am I living my path fully, do I live without regret?” so that we can say on whatever day is the end of our life, “Yes, I have lived my path with heart.” ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=454))
- May I be filled with loving-kindness. May I be well. May I be peaceful and at ease. May I be happy. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=467))
- As you say the phrases, you may also wish to use the image from the Buddha’s instructions: picture yourself as a young and beloved child, or sense yourself as you are now, held in a heart of loving-kindness. Let the feelings arise with the words. Adjust the words and images so that you find the exact phrases that best open your heart of kindness. Repeat the phrases again and again, letting the feelings permeate your body and mind. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=469))
- When we let go of our battles and open our heart to things as they are, then we come to rest in the present moment. This is the beginning and the end of spiritual practice. Only in this moment can we discover that which is timeless. Only here can we find the love that we seek. Love in the past is simply memory, and love in the future is fantasy. Only in the reality of the present can we love, can we awaken, can we find peace and understanding and connection with ourselves and the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=561))
- Spiritual work requires sustained practice and a commitment to look very deeply into ourselves and the world around us to discover what has created human suffering and what will free us from any manner of conflict. We must look at ourselves over and over again in order to learn to love, to discover what has kept our hearts closed, and what it means to allow our hearts to open. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=694))
- “If you haven’t cried a number of times, your meditation hasn’t really begun.” ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=803))
- As Achaan Chah put it, “If you haven’t cried deeply a number of times, your meditation hasn’t really begun.” ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=831))
- These areas of mindfulness are: awareness of the body and senses, awareness of the heart and feelings, awareness of the mind and thoughts, and awareness of the principles that govern life. (In Sanskrit these principles are called the dharma, or the universal laws.) ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=847))
- Most often, opening the heart begins by opening to a lifetime’s accumulation of unacknowledged sorrow, both our personal sorrows and the universal sorrows of warfare, hunger, old age, illness, and death. At times we may experience this sorrow physically, as contractions and barriers around our heart, but more often we feel the depth of our wounds, our abandonment, our pain, as unshed tears. The Buddhists describe this as an ocean of human tears larger than the four great oceans. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=914))
- Oscar Wilde wrote, “Hearts are meant to be broken.” ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=927))
- The Tibetan teacher Kalu Rinpoche puts it this way: You live in illusion and the appearance of things. There is a reality, but you do not know this. When you understand this, you will see that you are nothing, and being nothing you are everything. That is all. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1028))
- There is a traditional story about a Zen student who complained to his master that following the breath was boring. The Zen master grabbed this student and held his head under water for quite a long time while the student struggled to come up. When he finally let the student up, the Zen master asked him whether he had found breath boring in those moments under water. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1148))
- Only as a [spiritual] warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge. A warrior cannot complain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges. The basic difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge, while an ordinary man takes everything as a blessing or a curse. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1362))
- Just as the great oceans have but one taste, the taste of salt, so too there is but one taste fundamental to all true teachings of the Way, and this is the taste of freedom. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1391))
- The place where we can most directly open to the mystery of life is in what we don’t do well, in the places of our struggles and vulnerability. These places always require surrender and letting go: When we let ourselves become vulnerable, new things can be born in us. In risking the unknown we gain a sense of life itself. ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1461))
- For example, meditation may bring us face to face with the longing that keeps many of our lives in motion. At first the longing will appear to be a poison to get rid of if we can. But if we investigate it, we will find built into our longing a yearning for its opposite, the wholeness and connectedness that we seek. Somehow we must already be able to sense this completeness within us. So our longing is a reflection of this possibility. When we open and accept our longings, then the longing and emptiness itself can become included in a greater loving whole. Similarly, we can find gold in the judgment and anger we have, for within them is the valuing of justice and integrity. When we work with anger, it can be changed into a valuable medicine. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1465))
- Our spiritual life can open a dimension of our being where each person we meet can teach us like the Buddha and whatever we touch becomes gold. To do this we must make our very difficulties the place of our practice. Then our life becomes not a struggle with success and failure but a dance of the heart. It is up to us. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1475))
- “I can resist anything but temptation.” ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1574))
- George Bernard Shaw said, “There are two great disappointments in life. Not getting what you want and getting it.” ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1582))
- The process of such unskillful desire is endless, because peace comes not from fulfilling our wants but from the moment that dissatisfaction ends. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1583))
- When wanting is filled, there comes a moment of satisfaction, not from the pleasure, but from stopping of the grasping. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1584))
- demon of desire brings us. We discover that underneath unskillful desire is a deep spiritual longing for beauty, for abundance and completeness. Naming desire can lead us to discover this truest desire. One old teacher of mine said, “The problem with desire is that you do not desire deeply enough! Why not desire it all? You don’t like what you have and want what you don’t have. Simply reverse this. Want what you have and don’t want what you don’t have. Here you will find true fulfillment.” ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1601))
- We become angry either when we are hurt and in pain or when we are afraid. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1638))
- The next time anger and irritation spring up, see if just before they arose you felt fear or hurt. If you pay attention to the fear or pain first, does the anger even appear? ([Location 1639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031RS9WK&location=1639))

- Anger shows us precisely where we are stuck, where our limits are, where we cling to beliefs and fears. Aversion is like a warning signal that lights up and says, “Attached, attached.” The strength of our anger reveals the amount of our attachment.
