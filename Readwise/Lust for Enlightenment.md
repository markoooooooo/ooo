## Highlights
- Buddhist iconography is distinguished by its lavish use of the female form in all its sensuous glory.14 ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=242))
- This world is full of deception and falsehood and nothing is more deceiving than a woman’s appearance; Attracted to fine clothes and trinkets, Foolish men become mad with desire, But when one realizes that a woman’s charms are mere illusion, He will no longer be deceived. This is the way to liberation and purity of body and mind. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=323))
- “Everything decays; train with diligence; rely on yourselves, no one else.” ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=469))
- The puritan Buddha warned his monks, “The one thing that enslaves a man above all else is a woman. Her form, her voice, her scent, her attractiveness, and her touch all beguile a man’s heart. Stay away from them at all costs.”5 ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=527))
- Beautiful you may seem, But from the crown of your heads To the soles of your feet You are nothing more than bags of skin Filled with blood, pus, and filth. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=544))
- Imagine yourself, Buddha was said to have instructed certain people,11 in a charnel ground scattered with corpses: some swollen and blackened with decomposition; some pecked at by crows, ravens, and vultures and gnawed by dogs and jackals; some stripped of flesh; and some rotted away to dust. The body is really just an ulcer with nine gaping wounds filled with various mean impurities. Even the loveliest woman and the handsomest man will someday age into tottering old wrecks, wrinkled, bald, toothless, with blotchy skin, and then enter the grave.

- Indeed, the joy of being released from craving is ten times more delightful than all the pleasures of the world rolled into one. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=554))

- “Behold this body disfigured and corrupt, a vile mass of sores and maggots, now despised. Nothing is stable, nothing remains.” ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=564))
- The loveliest maiden eventually disappears in the depths of the earth, and even an emperor one day perishes like smoke. The delicate eyebrows of a beautiful woman vanish like mist, and her once sparkling teeth rot, no more permanent than dew. Sooner or later, the eyes of the most exquisite girl become small swamps and her ears empty holes for the wind to blow through. Her pink cheeks become a feast for flies, and her luscious lips food for crows. Her once-enchanting smile can no longer be seen on a weatherbeaten skeleton. Alive, she may have been the most sought-after of women; dead, no one will even go near her decayed corpse. Her lovely black hair is tangled among weeds and her graceful arms are covered with mold. Her sweet fragrance has been carried away forever by the wind.13 ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=568))
- Similarly, a monk was once confronted by a gorgeous stripper. After she had removed all her clothes, he demanded, “Now take off your skin!”17 ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=589))
- “It is better that your penis enter the mouth of a hideous cobra or a pit of blazing coals than enter a woman’s vagina.” ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=702))
- Vimalakīrti had a wife, children, and a host of female attendants, yet he remained untainted by desire. He freely mixed with all manner of people—on occasion, Vimalakīrti could be found in a brothel or a wine shop—all the time pointing the way to salvation. The monks were no match for him.2 ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1070))
- “This is not the way to meditate. You must place yourself in a state of contemplation where there is neither body nor mind; where you manifest ordinary behavior while in nirvana; where you act like a normal person without losing your spiritual nature; where your mind neither settles nor moves about; and where nothing troubles you at any stage of practice. In short, you must attain liberation without avoiding the passions that rule the world!” ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1075))
- Vimalakīrti cried out, “Wait! Do not be afraid. All things are mere phantoms—words, too. Do not be confused by them. Understand the true nature of all things, and you will be liberated.”4 ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1082))
- “In reality, there is neither male nor female.”5 ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1092))
- “Without entering the ocean of desire it is impossible to obtain an illumined mind.”6 We are also told of women who intentionally become courtesans in order to win men over; having caught them with the hook of desire, such female Bodhisattvas can teach those men to manifest the Buddha-mind. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1094))
- Later on in the text, arhats are criticized for becoming monks primarily out of fear, for attempting to circumvent samsara by totally negative, one-sided means. “Nirvana,” the sutra states, “consists of the elimination of all faults and impurities,” a condition not dependent on either the lay or monastic state; if one realizes the innate purity of mind, there will be liberation. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1105))
- More than a little vexed, Sāriputra demands to know, “How do you tell a true Buddhist?” The lady herself answers: “A Buddhist follows Buddha’s teachings and is compassionate toward Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike. A Buddhist can be a woman, adorned with jewels and wearing fine clothes, beautiful and fragrant, who embraces all sentient beings and grants all their desires. Her Buddha-mind remains intact under all conditions, and therefore she is superior to monks and arhats who cling to a one-sided attachment to meditation and asceticism.” ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1133))
- The Golden One champions the necessity of male and female union as the root of all existence. “Without sexual union, there would be no one born capable of experiencing the great bliss of enlightenment.” She instructs Buddha’s disciples not to get entangled by passion but also not to abandon it either. A state of equilibrium between the polarities of passion and the void is the ideal. Even as she makes sweet love to them, the Golden One instructs her patrons in the intricacies of Buddhism. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1150))
- We must, she instructs Sudhana, develop the mind of sharing, providing each sentient being with the means with which to attain liberation. ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1168))
- In the Noh drama the lady later appears to Saigyō as Fugen, and she tells him that her rejection was really an act of kindness designed to protect his reputation. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1205))
- exoteric and esoteric Buddhism. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1220))
- Won Hyo’s motto was, “Only one with no worries and no fears can conquer life, death, and transmigration” (a verse from the Avataṃsaka Sūtra of which The Pilgrimage of Sudhana forms a part).24 ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1233))
- Ruthless suppression of the natural propensity to seek union with a member of the opposite sex sours people, followers of the Tantra believe, making them morbid, compulsive, and neurotic. Annihilation of the sexual impulse is impossible for all but the very few, so it is far better for us to redirect and transform our natural desires. The undeniable bliss one feels during sexual climax can be, if understood properly, a religious experience of the highest order—indeed, sexual intercourse became the Tantric symbol supreme for the Great Bliss of Liberation. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1260))
- From the beginning in Buddhism it was implicit that “nirvana is samsara; the passions themselves constitute enlightenment.” Prior to Gotama’s Supreme Awakening, the world appeared to him to be samsara—hopelessly confused, corrupt, and evil. When he became a Buddha, however, everything was perceived in the radiance of nirvana, and existence, for him, turned orderly, wholesome, and good. The external factors surrounding Gotama/Buddha had not changed, of course; it was his consciousness that had been transformed. In other words, samsara is a disease of the mind, not a fixed condition. When the mind is overrun by uncontrollable thoughts and fears and clouded by passion, the world can seem a dreadful place; when the mind is free of all blemishes, calm and bright, there is nothing but nirvana. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1273))
- Passions, Tantric Buddhists state, are the raw material of enlightenment—not obstacles, but true building blocks. Sex, the greatest of passions, could if used properly be our greatest ally instead of our deadliest foe. In the Tantra, the sex act is neutral; if one acts like an animal or is in any way evil-minded, the repercussions are most grave, but if one behaves as a bodhisattva, liberation is close at hand for both partners. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1286))
- In any case, the sole motivation of a Tantric Buddhist must be the wish to liberate all sentient beings from suffering and distress. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1321))
- “Thus I have heard: When the Buddha was reposing in the vagina of his consort he delivered this discourse. . . .”34 The Buddhist tantras were organized into four levels of difficulty—kriyā-, caryā-, yoga-, and annuttara-yoga—corresponding to the stages of sexual love: smiles, longing gazes, embrace, and union. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1323))
- a Buddhist should never become attached to any person or thing, was the reasoning—and in others the couplings were totally random. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1347))
- Tales of the Eighty-four Buddhist Adepts, ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1360))
- Babhaha, the Free Lover. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1362))
- Through her skill as a Sky-walker, Tsogyel managed to convert seven men who gang-raped her. She raised their consciousness by singing this song: ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1427))
- Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, and Milarepa all used sex in their teaching. But the champion of sexual yoga was the “divine madman” Drukpa Kunley,68 a kind of Buddhist Tom Jones who was forever inserting his immense penis, “the flaming thunderbolt of Wisdom,” into the white lotus-mandala found between a woman’s legs. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1528))
- On another occasion, an important debate was being held between doctors of Buddhist philosophy. Kunley, instead of bowing to the doctors or to the main shrine, prostrated himself before a pretty young girl sitting on the steps. When the monks protested, Kunley gestured toward the girl’s bottom and said, “As the source of all that comes into this world, she—not your arid words or a building of stone—represents the real Mother of Wisdom.”75 ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1556))
- People say Drukpa Kunley is utterly mad— In Madness all sensory forms are the Path! People say Drukpa Kunley’s organ is immense— His member brings joy to the hearts of young girls! People say that Drukpa Kunley is too fond of sex— Congress results in a host of fine descendants!77 Although your mind may be virtuous and pure, The Buddha’s Teaching is not accomplished by staying at home. The teaching of the Tantric Mysteries is most profound, But liberation cannot be gained without profound experience. Drukpa Kunley may show the way, But you must traverse the Path by yourself.78 ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1565))
- If one’s thoughts toward the Dharma Were of the same intensity as those toward love, One would become a Buddha, In this very body, in this very life. ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1605))
- Break the bonds of ordinary love, Capture the treasure and become an immortal. True renunciation is to realize that the senses are innately pure, And that one is an image of the universe. Attain enlightenment and you will be liberated from the sea of deluded passion. Be settled in meditation and you will transcend the barriers of life and death. The respect of kings and the virtue of a Buddha will be yours If you bloom like a lotus flower in the midst of a raging fire. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1806))
- “Becoming a monk is easy; returning to the world is the real challenge. Too much moralizing destroys the spirit of Buddhism; sometimes it is necessary to refresh oneself in a pleasure pavilion.” ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1817))
- Lord and Lady of Secrets. This is the ideal Tantric Buddhist couple, representing the harmonization of spirit and matter, wisdom and means, male and female. The bliss obtained from such an integration of the womb and diamond realms of existence surpasses all other forms of delight. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1865))
- “If one is unable to conquer sexual desire, I shall take the body of a beautiful woman, let him make love to me, and eventually lead him to the Pure Land.” The inscription on this painting by Reigen states, “In the midst of the world’s corruption, a heart of pure jade.” ([Location 1875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1875))
- “Everything you contact is a place to practice the Way.” ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1883))
- The frog reflects to himself, “Although I am captivated now, eventually the emotion will subside and my mind will return to its source.” ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=1900))
- “It is easy to enter the world of the Buddha, but difficult to enter the world of the Devil.” ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2028))
- Sexual desire is constantly manifest in myriad forms, which are, in reality, inseparable from the unborn and undying Buddha-nature. ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2030))
- Tibetan Drukpa Kunley’s ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2036))
- Change base lust into refined love and it is worth more than a mountain of gold”— ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2051))
- For ten straight years, I reveled in pleasure houses. Now I’m all alone deep in a dark mountain valley. Thirty thousand leagues of clouds lie between me and the places I love. The only sound that reaches my ears if the melancholy wind blowing among the old pines. THE DHARMA MASTER OF LOVE ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2060))
- He did paintings of a shrimp, a symbol of longevity, with this bit of counsel: “If you wish to grow old like this, moderate your eating and sleep alone.” ([Location 2112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2112))
- “Meditation in action is a billion times superior to meditation in stillness.” ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2137))
- “Enlightenment and peace of mind are possible in any circumstance, even here in the flower and willow world. Look for Buddha everywhere and you can attain liberation.” ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2144))
- Falling in love is dangerous, For passion is the source of illusion; Yet being in love gives life flavor, And passions themselves Can bring one to enlightenment.41 ([Location 2183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2183))
- To conquer this world And control the future, Come, come, Let me help you become Buddha one time— Take my hand and sleep with me! ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2235))
- A face like a peach blossom, A heart full of love-play, A powdered face with scarlet lips. Worth more than any treasure, The source of life to be greatly venerated. Hail to Kannon, the Merciful and Compassionate! But why do the young men around here fear her?57 ([Location 2240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2240))
- Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form; Willows are green. Flowers are red.59 ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2253))
- Sometimes true compassion can be found Sporting in the boudoir of a pleasure girl; Enjoy then for a time the passion of a young beauty— On a spring day, peonies burst into full bloom. ([Location 2256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2256))
- Up and down, Up and down, I’ve got a lot of Endurance— Doesn’t anyone notice my true purpose?63 ([Location 2282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2282))
- Sitting facing a wall for nine years, big deal! I have been doing my work here in the floating world for ten! Passions and enlightenment are the two sinews of life, But if you are not deluded, they are one— Those elements exist together in daily life. Cut the red thread and become Buddha! For my customers, I turn into the net [of Kannon] Hauling them in or letting them sink themselves. My job is the same as yours!64 ([Location 2287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2287))
- Intercourse is the source of all good fortune; Unite, and taste the universe’s pleasures!66 ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2299))
- “Even following satori, the fundamental problem of sex persisted. Not until my forty-ninth year (Tesshū died at age fifty-two) was I able to transcend sexual passion.” A friend suggested that Tesshū was just getting old. “No,” Tesshū said. “What you mean by sexual passion is physical lust. I was over that by my mid-thirties. If one cannot penetrate the nature of sexual passion—the root of samsara and the basic life force—to its source, one’s enlightenment is worthless.” Sex is the supreme kōan. ([Location 2419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2419))
- A few texts list the types of wives that a man may have: murderous, deceitful, domineering, motherly, sisterly, friendly, and, best of all, subservient. ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2711))
- The fetus is attracted to one or the other parent; if it is repelled by the mother and attracted to the father, it will be a female child; if the opposite occurs, it will be a male. ([Location 2744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2744))
- It is the motive, not the act itself, which must be ethical. ([Location 2765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2765))
- Look for liberation in the midst of the realm of samsara. As the Zen Master Rinzai [Lin-chi] stated, “Cling to the sacred and disdain the profane and you will be sunk in the ocean of life and death forever.” Since male and female elements exist, they must possess virtue. Because there are men and women, passion naturally exists. It is foolish to say that passion is “nothing.” Passion is a useful tool for attaining enlightenment. Realize this and all your actions will be stainless. Men and women belong together; together they can proceed on the true Path. This is the meaning of “To refrain from sexual misconduct.”62 ([Location 2769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2769))
- If the act of sex is consummated selflessly and with compassion, if it is mutually enriching and ennobling, if it deepens one’s understanding of Buddhism, promotes integration and spiritual emancipation, and is, above all, beneficial to all the parties involved, it is “good.” If, on the contrary, sex erupts from animal passion, is based purely on physical pleasure, and originates in the desire to possess, dominate, or degrade, it is “evil.” ([Location 2775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2775))
- a Bodhisattva must never lie or deceive others, for that violates the reality of things.”63 ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2780))
- If your heart is pure, all things in your world will be pure. When this is true, even lust may win us enlightenment. ([Location 2784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JVRN082&location=2784))
