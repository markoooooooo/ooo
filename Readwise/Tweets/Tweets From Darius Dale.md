## Highlights
- I’m starting to grow concerned that the Fed pivot we are all focused on is not the pivot that will prompt the next bull market. 
  Sure, markets will melt up for a while when the Fed confirms a pause. But I’m less sure the ultimate lows will be in for most risk assets by then. https://t.co/XXC621KgX6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/42macroDDale/status/1584709952438153217))
