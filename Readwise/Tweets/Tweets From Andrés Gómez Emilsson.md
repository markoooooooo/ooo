## Highlights
- We need more philosophy of mind music videos. Pronto!

- We need basic scent literacy. Every high-school should have a "qualia elective" where you are taught the basics of a certain qualia variety. You'd learn things like the constituents of lavender, how to create a believable orange from scratch, and how to detect fake scents.

- I believe that there is a lot of artistic talent latent of people, if they are given the necessary tools to unlock it.
  How many Alberto Morrillas (creator of CK One) and Guerlains (Mitsouko) are there waiting to be found, if only we gave linalool bottles to high-schoolers? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1581812493290115072))
- @responsiblparty Oh no! Neroli is key!
  You are missing out big time! It's a very important scent!
  I even made a 45 minute long video all about neroli! It's THAT important!
  I recommend "Bright Neroli" by Ferrari. That's very well done. Good craftsmanship.

- If you cultivate and give love to the part of your brain that generates sacred-geometrical-shapes... You will be bathed with waves of love and happiness. Try it!
  (There's deep theory behind this, though it comes across as clueless hippie talk ðŸ˜‰ - works regardless!) https://t.co/26U8wtNUz1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1580611304116535296))
