- Let's cut the bullshit.
  Here is most people's problem:
  Either they have zero self-awareness.
  Or they get lost in overthinking.
  Solution?
  Active and methodical self-reflection.
  Let's see how this works. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591036561763745795))
- The difference between Self-Reflection is Overthinking is the following:
  One solves problems; The other creates more of them.
  No need to say which is which; you've guessed.
  Let's ditch overthinking and consider it doesn't exist.
  Let's focus on self-reflection. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591037068641198080))
- The act of self-reflection is to think back on your experiences and interpret them using them as a lens.
  In this instance, you're taking a step back and considering your behavior, beliefs, and life.
  Not judging, considering. Very important. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591037696130322433))
- Some questions to guide you through the process:
  -How can I improve this?
  -Where am I wrong?
  -Why am I wrong?
  -What did I achieve?
  -What can I be proud of?
  -Do I want more or less of this?
  -What is working and what is not?
  -What should I keep doing? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591038085122646016))
- It goes like this:
  1- Stop and evaluate: take some time alone and think about a precise event/decision/belief. Do not get lost in your thoughts.
  2- Look back and analyze it, identify and notice what you like and what you don't.

- 3- LISTEN; and this is the most important part.
  Given the step back you took, there is now less pressure on you to listen with more clarity to that inner voice. 
  It knows better ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591039101351956480))
- 4- Act.
  Now that you've identified what's wrong and allowed yourself to think, it's time to adjust ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591039586313990144))
- How do I effectively self-reflect?
  Meditate or journal your thoughts.
  Why not even both?
  The most important thing is to pick a time you won't interrupt.
  A "me time" that will not have to be stopped until you reach your conclusions.
  Make sure nobody interrupts you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591040087843905537))
- The thing is, this shouldn't be just an occasional thing.
  This should be done daily.
  That's how you keep track of your progress in life.
  That's how you evolve and keep yourself accountable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591040597900800001))
- You'd rather do that on your own that listen to what people's reflections on you are. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/EgoDriv/status/1591041096171200512))
- Here is the thing:
  In just 3 weeks, you could turn your life around.
  By following the self-sufficiency program, you get guidance for all the above and a lot more that wasn't mentioned in this thread.
