## Highlights
- The philosophy here is that power is almost everything. It doesn't matter what you think is right; it matters what you can demonstrate and enforce is right.
  What you have the power to enforce.
  Be right. Be powerful.
  Only the combination of both matters. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1584714423130017793))
