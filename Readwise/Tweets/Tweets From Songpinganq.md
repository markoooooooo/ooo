## Highlights
- @sleeplessincol2 Shenzhen. Another day.
  Tens of thousands of stormtroopers arriving to lockdown this neighbourhood.
  They are going from door-to-door to test everyone.
  As long as one person tests positive, entire population of his or her apartment building will be sent off to quarantine camps. https://t.co/eJtJzfM6a6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/songpinganq/status/1580434727978164225))
