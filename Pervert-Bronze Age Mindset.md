## Highlights
There is an “intelligence” in all things, and inborn in our bodies before anything to do with the brain or the nervous system. And all “adaptations,” no matter how much natural or unnatural selection may have gone to spreading them within a population, occur not by random but by a spontaneous correspondence of some kind between the organism and the environment. — location: [151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DJQ89TD&location=151) ^ref-15058

If a god showed himself today to you, in a dream, would you have the inner energy and power to honor him and do his bidding in the world? Or would you, neutered by the modern pervasive hivemind of the slave, dismiss it, and yourself as unreal or unworthy, when it is the modern bugman and his blabbering that lacks reality. But I want you to be intoxicated with the highest enthusiasm and ready to receive these greatest blessings with great confidence! — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DJQ89TD&location=539) ^ref-40778

“It’s important never to be ‘ambitious.’ Men of ‘ambition’ are losers. Act and feel like a winner and good things, friends, and victory will come.” — location: [1991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DJQ89TD&location=1991) ^ref-49812

They will take over night clubs, bars, brothels, hotels, casinos, pornography, and much worse, and rather than live to insulate themselves from the vice promoted by this world, they will intensify it and learn to wield it as a great weapon. — location: [2471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DJQ89TD&location=2471) ^ref-30639
