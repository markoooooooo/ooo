But, as always, the key to making sense of our lives lies in those details that seem most nonsensical. The small strangenesses surrounding us are our best possible clues to reality. —PETER KINGSLEY, Reality — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=192) ^ref-60457

Have you ever actually sat down and listened to what quantum physicists or cosmologists are saying about the nature of matter and the structure of the universe? To any ordinary mortal, it is all pure craziness: matter as congealed energy, the relativity of space and time, nonlocality, entangled particles that communicate instantly across space-time, multiple dimensions that the primate brain simply cannot imagine or picture, dark energy that, we are now told, constitutes the vast majority of the universe, a “big bang” out of nowhere and nothing, parallel universes, and on and on we go into one impossible thing after another. And yet, we are told, this is precisely what the empirical evidence and mathematics point toward. — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=706) ^ref-25472

The point is that A. J. Ayer, one of the most rigorous philosophical thinkers of the twentieth century, was willing and able to think entirely outside his familiar boxes about these subjects after his near-death experience, but not before it. He was willing to be flipped, even if he never quite flipped, not at least in this life that those of us who have not died can perceive and confirm. — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=836) ^ref-34084

William James called these moments “noetic.” What he meant by this Greek-based word is that such experiences carry a direct knowledge that cannot be reduced or explained by any simple cognition or sensory input. One can think of this as knowing something directly without or outside the “filter” of the brain and its various cognitive and sensory mediations. Consciousness, freed from those buffers and blocks, simply knows. Here is another future form of knowledge that is also ancient. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=899) ^ref-28262

Shermer recognizes, in my own words, that the force and power of the paranormal do not lie in any posited mechanism (a battery or wire being suddenly jarred into place, for example). They lie in the meaning and human emotion that the event effortlessly expressed. Put a bit differently, such paranormal events have little to do with the methods of conventional science and everything to do with our humanity and, at least in this case, with love. — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1142) ^ref-22104

---
Significantly, Einstein equated this cosmically attuned mind with a most basic and most profound religious sensibility, a “peculiar religious feeling” specific to the scientist, but one that had journeyed very far from its historical roots in figures like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton.7 Each of these men understood the mathematical laws and geometrical structures of the world to be ultimately located in the mind of God. — location: [1289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1289) ^ref-60789

---
In effect, such thinkers had accepted Descartes’s earlier splitting of reality into two separate realms (the mental and the material) but then completely ignored one half of it as unimportant, even nonexistent. Newton’s mechanics worked wonders with the “Quantity or Number” thing but said absolutely nothing about the mental world (even though Newton himself was obsessed with theological, occult, and esoteric matters). The eventual result was an entirely objective, mechanical reality completely devoid not only of God but of any mental or conscious dimension whatsoever, a reality entirely independent of any conscious observer or personal dimension. — location: [1302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1302) ^ref-63148

This was what would eventually become the reigning “positivism” of scientific orthodoxy, which came down to this: The full truth about the material world resides only in mathematics, meaningful concepts can only be stated as quantities, and no other language is real knowledge.

Einstein warned his listeners not to confuse the technical and mathematical successes of science with the assumed truth of the scientists’ present interpretations of the sciences, which, in his own language, are little more than temporary “illusions.” He openly proclaimed the need for a new religious or spiritual orientation, one inspired, purified, and guided by modern science: — location: [1331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1331) ^ref-39186

Put a bit differently, it was Bohr’s position that uncertainty is not a function of an incomplete theory whose loopholes we will eventually close, which was contrary to Einstein’s position. Rather, uncertainty and indeterminacy are woven into the very nature of things. To invoke the lovely paradoxical phrase of Abner Shimony, quantum reality is “objectively indefinite.”16 — location: [1364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1364) ^ref-46806

---
Bell’s Theorem was later repeatedly tested under increasingly sophisticated laboratory conditions at the University of California, Berkeley (John Clauser and colleagues), at the University of Paris at Orsay (Alain Aspect and colleagues), and at the University of Geneva (Nicolus Gisin and colleagues). The eventual results were unequivocal but also bizarre in the extreme. Put simply, they demonstrated conclusively that Bohr was right and Einstein was wrong. Put less personally and more complexly, they provided empirical confirmation of the phenomenon of “entanglement”—the very phenomena Einstein considered absurd and impossible. In lay terms, these empirical tests demonstrated that particles that have once interacted become “entangled” and thereafter correlate with one another’s internal states (like “spin”) instantly, regardless of the spatial or temporal distances the two particles have since traveled. Entangled particles form an indivisible whole and cannot be treated as if they were separate from one another. — location: [1378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1378) ^ref-51528

Consider the following gloss on what Bell’s Theorem implies by the philosopher of science Robert Nadeau and the physicist Menas Kafatos after their own fifteen-year dialogue: — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1404) ^ref-36099

---
All particles in the history of the cosmos have interacted with other particles in the manner revealed by the [entanglement] experiments… from the big bang to the present. Even the atoms in our bodies are made up of particles that were once in close proximity to the cosmic fireball, and other particles that interacted at that time in a single quantum state can be found in the most distant star. Also consider … that quantum entanglement grows exponentially with the number of particles involved in the original quantum state and that there is no theoretical limit on the number of these entangled particles. If this is the case, the universe on a very basic level could be a vast web of particles, which remain in contact with one another over any distance in “no time” in the absence of the transfer of energy or information. This suggests, however strange or bizarre it might seem, that all of physical reality is a single quantum system that responds together to further interactions.18 — location: [1406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1406) ^ref-51110

---
In the new quantum real, there can be no reductionism in the classical sense, since the organization of the “particles” lies inside themselves, as it were, within that strange phenomenon called entanglement. There is no external communication, no chemical reactions, no information signal “between” this and that particle. There is only an instantaneous response from nature outside of space and outside of time. It is as if everything is already one thing and is simply responding to itself, evolving itself through time. — location: [1419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1419) ^ref-42001

---
For example, consider the predictable rebuttals to my earlier observations about the strange resonances between the apparent philosophical implications of quantum mechanics and comparative mystical literature, particularly the latter’s insistence that consciousness is fundamental. Such rebuttals come down to (a) some false conflation with or confusion between consciousness and cognition, or between consciousness and the brain, or between consciousness and social ego or personal self (all conflations or confusions that the mystical literature strongly denies and deconstructs); or (b) some version of materialism or physicalism that wants to deny the existence of consciousness as such altogether. In other words, all the rebuttals come down to an unexamined commitment to Newtonian physicalism and a rejection of any form of fundamental subjectivity or first-person direct knowledge. — location: [1432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1432) ^ref-10597

We are in this way caught, immediately, in a fundamental paradox that will never be resolved by studying more objects.

The single big question that drives most of the modern philosophy of mind is this: “What is the relationship between mind and matter, and how is this relationship mediated or produced by the brain?” On the surface, this is a remarkably easy question to understand. We experience the material world “out there.” We experience ourselves as conscious beings “in here.” So how are this “inside” and that “outside” related? — location: [1515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1515) ^ref-13460

The philosopher of mind Philip Goff points out with particular verve that since Galileo, the physical sciences have proceeded by putting aside the ontological question (the is question) and focusing only on the behavior or structure question: — location: [1525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1525) ^ref-35310

---
But for Goff, no such third-person empirical approach will ever get us to an adequate understanding of consciousness as a first-person presence. No experiment can get us there, because “the reality of consciousness is a datum in its own right, a datum distinct from the data of third-person observation and experiment.”23 — location: [1540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1540) ^ref-21177

---
Goff thinks this looking into the microscope involves two sources of data: (1) the findings of the sciences with respect to the causal structures of the material world (particularly quantum physics), and (2) “the direct first-person access each of us has to the nature of consciousness,” or what he calls simply “the datum of consciousness.”26 — location: [1553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1553) ^ref-41513

In recent Western intellectual history (in the last half millennium or so), three answers have dominated the discussion, and in more or less this historical order: dualism, idealism, and materialism. — location: [1558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1558) ^ref-15748

---
Today, the more nuanced position is called “physicalism,” by which is meant the thesis “that the complete nature of fundamental reality can in principle be captured in the vocabulary of the natural sciences,” particularly physics.28 — location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1573) ^ref-44704

---
Indeed, the “hard” problem of consciousness, as David Chalmers famously dubbed it, is often singled out as the most important question in all of modern science. Only the nature of “life” in the biological sciences comes close. And many thinkers suspect that these two questions—”What is consciousness?” and “What is life?”—are, in fact, the same question in two different guises. — location: [1585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1585) ^ref-46590

---
Dual-aspect monists, then, possess an elegant answer to how we arrive at our daily experience of twoness, that is—how we arrive at our common sense of being an interior subject perceiving an exterior reality. Our ordinary experience of being “inside” a body looking “outside” is a result of this deeper superreality being split into two experienced dimensions by the brain-body and its particular adaptive needs and spatial and temporal perspective. — location: [1674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1674) ^ref-36775

---
For a thinker like Atmanspacher, the phenomenal experience of time itself is also created by this symmetry breaking of the deeper reality. Ultimately, there is no inside or outside, no subject or object. Ultimately, there is no stream of time and no structured space. There is only a fundamental oneness that is neither mental nor material. This is what Pauli and Jung called the holistic One World (unus mundus). — location: [1677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1677) ^ref-2220

---
The felt atomism and pluralism of panpsychism is thus answered by a radical monism that is, in the end, inaccessible to human thinking and ordinary human experience (a very important qualification, as we shall see in a moment), since the latter is always an after-the-fact function of the split “up here,” well above the One World. We do not just experience this split as the typical subjective-objective structure of our phenomenal experience and grammar. We are this split.37 — location: [1685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1685) ^ref-62755

Wendt advances the elegant thesis that most of the dilemmas around agency, subjectivity, freedom, and experience that philosophers and social scientists—and, by extension, I would add, virtually all humanists—struggle with are only problems if we restrict our thinking to what is now an outdated metaphysical world, that of Newtonian classical physics.38 The mind-matter problem, for example, is simply intractable within any classical material worldview, since it is this classical paradigm and its grammar of individual “subjects” and material “objects” that produce the presumed paradox of the mental and the material in the first place. — location: [1699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1699) ^ref-54852

---
Yes, of course, our bodies are classical objects, but our forms of consciousness are not. Mind and social life in particular are quantum mechanical phenomena for Wendt, not classical objects in three-dimensional space. Accordingly, they work like a quantum mechanical wave function (in the Copenhagen interpretation). Such a wave function is a potential reality, not an actual one. Moreover, it is by definition “plural,” “paradoxical,” and “multiple” (my terms), since the wave function is a set of probabilistic patterns mathematically superimposed upon one another. Until, that is, the same wave function is measured by a conscious agent and “collapses” into a singular material, measurable, empirical event or “particle.” — location: [1706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1706) ^ref-48023

Here, Kastrup explains, we are embodied forms of cosmic mind, split off “alters” in some vast multiple-personality order. These alters have entered God’s dream through sexual reproduction and evolutionary biology in order to wake up within the dream, look around the physical universe as the interior of God’s brain, and reflect on our own cosmic nature within this same neural galactic network. Kastrup summarizes our cosmic condition this way: “Put in another way, the universe is a scan of God’s brain; except that you don’t need the scanner: you’re already inside God’s brain so all you have to do is look around. Your perceptions of the sun, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc., are as inaccessible to God as the patterns of firing neurons in your brain—with all their beauty and complexity—are inaccessible to you in any direct way.”52 We are the universe becoming self-aware. We know what God does not know, since we are “inside” God. But—and here is the even more astonishing thing—we have access to what God knows, since we are, in fact, embodied, particularized forms of this same cosmic mind. We exist in, and so can know, both levels of the real. — location: [1836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1836) ^ref-59056

It is an exploration of how cosmic consciousness projects itself into narrative forms, into story, or what we have come to call “myth,” and then wakes up out of that same story or myth to know itself not as other but as Self, as Mind, as consciousness as such before and beyond any single ego or organism. — location: [1855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1855) ^ref-30927

If we are ever going to accept, much less understand, the reality and messages of these events, we are going to have to come to terms with the imagination and its power to shape both the mental and material. — location: [1884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1884) ^ref-47108

---
It all comes down to the in-between. We all assume, on some level, that there is a mental world “in here” and a material world “out there,” and that there is only one way that knowledge about that material world can get to this mental world—through the senses. In the modern secular world, we also generally assume that any form of knowledge—say in a big dream, a sudden precognitive intuition, or a near-death experience—is not real knowledge, since it is only “in the head” of the visionary. It is a hallucination. It is imagined and thus “imaginary.” — location: [1889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1889) ^ref-42685

---
But this is not even true in the sciences. After all, the privileged mode of knowledge in the sciences is mathematics, an entirely formal or symbolic language that, for reasons that few people dare to think about, actually mirrors and maps the material world in eerily precise ways.3 And, although the mathematics of the sciences can be checked through experimentation and is related to observation, technically speaking, none of this mathematical knowledge comes through the senses. — location: [1899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1899) ^ref-18009

---
Mathematics is “symbolic” knowledge, by which I mean that it is not what it signifies but somehow participates in that which it signifies. No scientist or mathematician believes that the squiggly lines that we call “Arabic numbers” invented by medieval Muslim intellectuals exist as such out there, but all of science proceeds on the philosophical assumption that such numbers do, in fact, represent some relatively precise, pragmatically approximate, or reliable relationship between a human subject and an objective physical world—that is, between the mental and the material domains. — location: [1903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1903) ^ref-21732

---
Numbers are symbols that mean something other than what they appear to mean (squiggly lines on a page, screen, or chalkboard) but nevertheless participate in some fundamental way in that which they symbolize (the workings of the physical world) and in that in which they appear (the human mind). In this way, they enable the human mind to commune indirectly with the deepest hidden structures of material reality. They join the knower and the known, the mental and the material. — location: [1907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1907) ^ref-50230

---
And, regardless of our present denials, symbolic processes continue to operate in extremely common human experiences, like dreams, literary, artistic, or intellectual creativity, as well as in more extreme and uncommon ones, like those of our flipped scientists. — location: [1912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1912) ^ref-34765

---
Because this deeper ground of being is before and beyond all mental or material form, and is neither mental nor material, it cannot “speak” in human language or even in mathematics. It is of an entirely different ontological order, and so it “speaks” to us in the only way it can: in superstrange images, open paradoxes, and bizarre or absurd narratives. — location: [1920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1920) ^ref-42654

---
There are also more secular, purely horizontal examples today. Self-described “party-loving jock” and “college dropout” Jason Padgett is such a case. Despite never making it past pre-algebra, after getting struck on the head during a violent mugging, he became a kind of mathematical genius who “sees” geometric and fractal patterns in the natural world, from the flowing of water to the shape of leaves on a tree. He is now interested in number theory and has been described as both a savant and synesthetic prodigy.4 Here mathematical and visionary forms of knowledge work together in perfect tandem, probably because they ultimately draw on the same deep structures of the human mind. Please note that it was a brain injury that released such powers. — location: [1929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=1929) ^ref-27360

What the conventional consensus essentially says to such an astonished or flipped human being is this: “Never mind. Move on.

---
He shows us how the ancient Greeks came to mark these genres with a number of words, the most important of which was symbola or “symbols.” In Struck’s elegant expression, such symbols marked “the limits of their texts,” that is, the places where the oracle, the poem, the myth, or the philosophical riddle carried their readers and listeners over into a realm of experience and truth that could not be captured by ordinary thinking or by any simple description. — location: [2056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2056) ^ref-33990

---
The word symbol itself is significant. It refers to two things “put together” (sym-ballein). It originally had nothing to do with literary or religious mysteries. Rather, the term invoked the notions of an “agreement,” the token that authenticates a “contract,” a “passport,” or “watchword,” or—much closer to the later meanings—an “ominous chance meeting” on the road signaling some divine intentionality or hidden purpose. — location: [2059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2059) ^ref-37740

---
The logic of the symbol can also be read as an expression of a dual-aspect monism—that is, an ontology that assumes a deeper oneness from which a twoness emerges and between which the communication/communion/contract takes place. A symbol here is not a message from a source to a receiver, nor is it an arbitrary projection of a human being, but a coded meaning or message that appears between a subject and an object, or between the mental and the material domains. — location: [2077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2077) ^ref-53870

… in consensus reality synchronization emerges across the imaginations of multiple conscious entities, so to form a coherent shared picture. The constraints entailed by such emergent synchronization may be what we call the laws of physics. Perhaps the apparently fixed mechanisms of nature are merely an epiphenomenon; an emergent property of the sympathetic harmonization of different imaginations, imagination itself being the true primary substance of reality. Perhaps the laws of physics can themselves be reduced to a fundamental metaphysics of psyche.18 — location: [2144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2144) ^ref-16178

What this actually looked like to him in his own altered states was a geometric world that expresses information through Christmas ball–like globes, “Kandinsky scintilla” (after the esoterically inclined abstract artist), mandalalike patterns, alien sci-fi landscapes, and fractal patterns, all of which he also illustrates in his book with computer-generated (that is, mathematically generated) images. — location: [2169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2169) ^ref-44287

I take science itself as one of our best guides here. In order to advance our knowledge of particle physics, we had to build billion-dollar technologies to expose matter to some of the most extreme and violent conditions in the universe. Only then did matter display some of its deepest secrets in the form of quantum fields, which, in turn, gave us a window into the high-energy states of the early cosmos. While ethically we cannot expose people to extreme and violent conditions, life does this for us. — location: [2223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2223) ^ref-42312

A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the “Universe,” a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest—a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons near us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.1 — location: [2356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2356) ^ref-47152

It was Whitman, often called the first and greatest of American poets, who first used the word spirituality in this modern sense (in his 1871 book, Democratic Vistas).

Such a realization of being caught in a story we ourselves are writing as unconscious gods can be terrifying, depressing, even nihilistic. Morton attempts to move us from the dark depression to the sweet gnosis of directly knowing who and what we already are. And what we already are is truly fantastic: 5-D or “X-beings” endowed with spectral superpowers that give witness to the future human, a massive transdimensional hyperobject awakening to its own actual condition, connected to everything there is, and literally and truly cosmic.22 — location: [2671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NS9QXSL&location=2671) ^ref-56218

They are deeply ambiguous. Am I having something real or is this an illusion or delusion? What type of illusion? What form of real?

Quantum physics is a “flipped science,” one in which consciousness is no longer understood as an epiphenomenon, but as fundamental to the very nature of nature.
