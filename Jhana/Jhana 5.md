Called the immaterial states, 5th to 8th.

Really different from the first 4.

Passing entirely beyond all bodily sensations.

Concentrated enough on what you're doing to enter and sustain these immaterial states that you're unaware of your body. The catch is that if you think of your body to check whether you still feel it then you will become aware and feel your body. It's only in retrospect that you can realize you were unaware of your body.

## Sphere of infinite space
- The word translated as sphere is actually the same word used for eye and sight AND ear and sound. So sensing or experiencing infinite or limitless space.
- Getting there you is you take something you can imaginatively expand without limits and just focus on the expansion until suddenly vast empty space appears before you.
- Like you walked up to the edge of the grand canyon and there's no bottom or other side.
