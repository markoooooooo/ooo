Beyond pleasure and pain.

Contains mindfulness fully purified by [[equanimity]].

Emotionally neutral state, not pleasant nor unpleasant.

Very quiet and still. People speak of it as the state of equanimity.

Better coaching cue: to focus on quiet stillness (which focuses you on equanimity, telling people to focus on equanimity can be too vague)

Still aware of your body.

According to the suttas you can drench, steep, satturate and suffuse your body with the piti and suka or the suka free from piti or the pure bright mind in the 4th.
