THERE WAS A CERTAIN SADHAKA who frequented forest glades where he thought there were no other people. When he felt he was in total isolation, he wrapped his siddhi pills in three types of metal and secreted them beneath the roots of a tree… The acarya [Kṛiṣṇācārya] discovered them and steadied his mind. About an hour later, sounds and light spontaneously arose from the pills. When the acarya put them into his mouth he was able to see the realms of the gods and yaksha, and he also found that he could travel to those places in a flash if he wished to.

THIS IDEA OF PRIMITIVE SECRET SOCIETIES reminds us of the Buddhist [tantra called] Guhya Samāja – the name itself has the same meaning [i.e. “secret society”]. Tantric converts to early Buddhism, although they professed a belief in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, they did not give up the traditional beliefs and rituals they used to practice in secret.

Over a decade before his work on soma, R. Gordon Wasson published a paper on the worldwide belief that mushrooms are engendered by thunderstorms.30 That being the case, Indra, as wielder of thunderbolts (i.e. lightning) was the god who caused mushrooms to sprout. Specifically, it was believed in India that the sound of the thunder caused mushrooms to appear.c In fact, it has recently been discovered that electrical discharges, such as lightning, while they may not actually cause mushrooms to appear, do significantly increase yields in commercial mushroom farming.31 — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07T16C2YT&location=1004) ^ref-45945

Evidence for the taboo is also found in the Laws of Manu which forbids even touching a mushroom. An ancient commentary on this passage states that those who eat mushrooms are equivalent to priest-killers. All of this leads one to believe that, not only were mushrooms held in awe, but also that they were associated with the priestly caste. — location: [1449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07T16C2YT&location=1449) ^ref-31584

Buddhist scripture often refers to him by the Sanskrit title Śākyamuni, which is usually translated as “sage of the Śākya clan” though “sage” hardly captures the full meaning of muni. The munis who appear in the Vedas are semi-divine shaman-like beings with the power of flight. — location: [1487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07T16C2YT&location=1487) ^ref-19147
